# How to install - reminder
0. Docs:  https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs
1. Download flashing tool - teensy (from ergodox-ez visual designer)
2. Setup build environment: https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started

QUICK HOWTO WSL:  (this is not supported anymore it seems, why?)
The Toolchain setup is done through the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and the process is fully automated. If you want to do everything manually, there are no other instructions than the scripts themselves, but you can always open issues and ask for more information.
Open "Bash On Ubuntu On Windows" from the start menu.
Go to the directory where you cloned qmk_firmware. Note that the paths start with /mnt/ in the WSL, so you have to write for example cd /mnt/c/path/to/qmk_firmware.
Run util/wsl_install.sh and follow the on-screen instructions.
Close the Bash command window, and re-open it.
You are ready to compile and flash the firmware!

3. Build the firmware with:  
Run the following in the root qmk folder:
make KEYBOARD=ergodox_ez KEYMAP=dvorak_programmer_swe

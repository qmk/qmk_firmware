# replicaJunction - Ergodox (EZ) Layout

Most of the goodies in this layout are defined in [my userspace folder](../../../../users/replicaJunction/readme.md). Better explanations of the interesting features are provided there.

One feature is worth pointing out here, since it's keyboard-specific: handling of the LEDs. Normally, I use the LEDs to indicate layer state, but it's occasionally useful to be able to view the system state as well (num lock, caps lock, scroll lock). The final layer in the keymap, `L_SYSLEDS`, is used to indicate this. I have a MO key that temporarily switches the LED behavior to show system state, and on this layer, the three keys with LEDs are each used to toggle the respective lock.

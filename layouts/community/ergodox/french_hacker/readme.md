# French hacker layout

[Colemak Mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) layout for
users keeping an `azerty` layout configuration on their OS.

## Introduction

This keymap is for users keeping their operating systems configured with
`azerty` - for typing passwords in their native languages, or for their laptop
keyboard - but who wants a Colemak Mod-DH layout on their mechanical keyboard.

The symbols layers was done after analysing various programming
languages sources codes and should be close to optimal for typing
confort, see the link at the end of the README.

The design is done to minimize the usage of the pinky fingers and reduces stress
on the hands, thus Alt and Ctrl keys are accessible for both hands.

## Flashing the firmware

```
qmk flash -kb ergodox_ez -km french_hacker

# Jacob Jerrell's Ergodox Layout

This is my original QMK keyboard. There isn't much to see here aside from some control over the 3 ergodox_right LEDs for layer & modifier indication.

The bulk of the functionality is implemented in [my userspace](../../../../users/jjerrell) so it can be shared among my other keyboards.

# JJerrell's Planck EZ Layout

As with my other keymaps, this layout is a close adaptation of the Neo keyboard. Obvious differences are that the alpha keymap is Workman and if you're already used to the secondary layers of the Neo keymap, this might be very uncomfortable for you because of slight variations.

The keymap has been setup to pretty much remove the center columns above the spacebar and limit use of the bottom row by supplying paths to removed functionality that are simpler to process mentally and require less finger acrobatics.

My ownership of this keyboard could not have been easily predicted because my original justification of this hobby was health related. I found QMK through the Ergodox EZ and this keyboard is a result of that discovery -- I could not live without some QMK features. As you can see, my problem has come full circle... now I use this keyboard when I'm not at a desk and it's tiny. This is offset by eliminating use of the center columns, relying on a symbol layer almost exclusively, and relying on a navigation layer instead of getting by with the minimum on the alpha layers which became uncomfortable even with the thumbs doing the heavy lifting and mods being comfortably placed on the home row.

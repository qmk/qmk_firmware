# Juno's Universal ortholinear 4x12 Layout
created by Juno Nguyen

## Features:
* **Minimal changes from the default keymap**: to minimize re-adaptation.
* **Top corner Esc**: swapped with Tab.
* **Double function ShiftEnter**: hold for Right Shift; tap for Enter.
* **Removed infrequently used keys**: Euro-specific keys.
* **Custom Fn layer**: inspired by Pok3r and refined over time.
* **SpaceFn**: the ultimate way to Fn.
* **Double arrow clusters**: both Fn + WASD and Fn + IJKL are simultaneously usable for maximum comfort.
* **Gaming-specific layer**: T-inverted arrow cluster shape; swapped Raise and Lower for easy access to numeric keys (for switching weapons in action games); standard-positioned bottom modifiers.
* **LED indicator**: lighting up when Fn or Gaming layer is activated.
* **Audio indicators**: Caps Lock and gaming layer.

Refined since September 2017.

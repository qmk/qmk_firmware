# brandonschlack's 4x12 Ortho Keymap

This layout is based on the Planck layout. It is macOS-centric, with Colemak and DVORAK removed as I don't use them.

## Keyboards Using This Layout

* [Planck](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/planck)
* [Plaid](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/plaid)
* [JNAO](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/planck) (FORCE_LAYOUT=ortho_4x12)

## Features

* *Enter* acts as *Right Shift* when held
* On either **LOWER** or **RAISE** layers, tapping *Shift* will toggle *Caps Lock*, hold for Shift.
* Bottom left key is *Hyper* (Shift+Control+Option+Command) which I use to map global shortcuts in macOS.
  * Holding *Esc* will also act as Hyper.
* **ADJUST** Layer
  * Make command for compiling keyboard firmmware, a Reset key, and Debug toggle.
  * Mission Control, Launchpad, and Sleep Display macOS macros
  * Alt-Gui swapping

# bcat's 60% Tsangan HHKB layout

This is a Tsangan/HHKB (split backspace, split right shift) layout following
the [traditional HHKB layout](https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Professional2)
with a few changes:

* The Delete key is mapped as Backspace (HHKB DIP switch 3).

* The Alt and Super keys are swapped to put Alt directly adjacent to the
spacebar (HHKB DIP switch 5).

* The left Super key is replaced with another Function key (HHKB DIP switch 2).
Unlike on the real HHKB, this key triggers a different Function 2 layer. (This
also helps prevent accidental Super key presses while gaming.)

* The Function 2 layer contains reset keys, RGB underglow and backlight
controls (in place of the arrow and navigation keys), and media controls
(centered around the ESDF cluster).

* The Function 2 layer also has the F1-F12 keys mapped just like the Function 1
layer. This is a concession to gaming because it enables these keys to be
easily typed with the left hand, without taking the right hand off the mouse.

* The leftmost and rightmost bottom row keys are mapped to Ctrl rather than
anything more useful because most of my Tsangan PCBs actually have HHKB plates
and/or blockers, so there aren't switches installed in those positions.

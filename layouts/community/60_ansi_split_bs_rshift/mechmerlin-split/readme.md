MechMerlin's Split ANSI 60% Layout
======================

This is the 60% layout with split backspace and right shift used by u/merlin36, 
host of the [MechMerlin](www.youtube.com/mechmerlin) YouTube channel.

It is used on his   
[Sentraq S60-X RGB](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/s60_x)   
[MechanicalKeyboards.com FaceW](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/bfake)   

## Keymap Notes
- Highly influenced by the KBP V60 and WKL B.Face standard layouts
- Does not support any form of inswitch or underglow lighting as Merlin hates them.
- Arrow toggle switch is the 1u key by right shift

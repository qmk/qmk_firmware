# bcat's 60% ANSI split backspace/right-shift layout

This is a hybrid of an HHKB layout and a standard ANSI bottom row. It's nice if
you want to fill out a 60% case with no blockers, or just really want a 6.25U
spacebar. The arrow and navigation keys match a standard HHKB layout using the
Fn key next to the right shift key. Additionally, the redundant Fn key on the
bottom row activates an adjust layer with controls for RGB underglow and
backlight, as well as media keys centered around the ESDF cluster.

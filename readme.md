# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is my fork from the [upstream](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) (the original [README](readme.md)).

I [contributed](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/1922) the `RETRO_TAPPING` function (it's now included int the upstream.)

I use ErgoDox-Ez. Here's [my personal keymap](https://github.com/tsankuanglee/qmk_firmware/tree/tsankuanglee_ergodox_ez/keyboards/ergodox_ez/keymaps/tsankuanglee), in the branch [tsankuanglee_ergodox_ez](https://github.com/tsankuanglee/qmk_firmware/tree/tsankuanglee_ergodox_ez).

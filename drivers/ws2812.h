 * The WS2812 datasheets define T1H 900ns, T0H 350ns, T1L 350ns, T0L 900ns. Hence, by default, these
 * are chosen to be conservative and avoid problems rather than for maximum throughput; in the code,
 * this is done by default using a WS2812_TIMING parameter that accounts for the whole window (1250ns)
 * and defining T1H and T0H; T1L and T0L are obtained by subtracting their low counterparts from the window.
 *
 * However, there are certain "WS2812"-like LEDs, like the SK6812s, which work in a similar
 * communication topology but use different timings for the window and the T1L, T1H, T0L and T0H.
 * This means that, albeit the same driver being applicable, the timings must be adapted.

/** \mainpage Partially Interrupt Driven Mouse Device Demo
 *
 *  Mouse demonstration application, using endpoint interrupts for the
 *  exchange of data to the USB host. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mouse using the basic USB HID
 *  drivers in all modern OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). It is
 *  boot protocol compatible, and thus works under compatible BIOS as if
 *  it was a native mouse (e.g. PS/2).
 *  
 *  On startup the system will automatically enumerate and function
 *  as a mouse when the USB connection to a host is present. To use
 *  the mouse, move the joystick to move the pointer, and push the
 *  joystick inwards to simulate a left-button click. The HWB serves as
 *  the right mouse button.

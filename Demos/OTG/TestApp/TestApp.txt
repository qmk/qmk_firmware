 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Test application. Demonstrates several aspects of the LUFA
 *  Library. On startup the current temperature will be printed
 *  through the USART every 10 seconds, and the current joystick
 *  position will be indicated via the LEDs on the selected board.
 *  Pressing the HWB will initiate the USB subsystem, enumerating
 *  the device (which has <b>no actual functionality beyond
 *  enumeration as a device or as a host in this demo</b>, and serves
 *  only to demonstrate the USB portion of the library). It will
 *  also suspend the joystick and temperature monitoring tasks.
 * 
 *  Pressing the HWB a second time will turn off the USB system
 *  and resume the temperature printing task (but not the joystick
 *  monitoring task).
 *
 *  When activated, the USB events will be printed through the
 *  serial USART.
 *
 *  When the USB subsystem is activated, the board LEDs will show
 *  the current USB status.

 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Keyboard host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Keyboard host, for USB keyboards using
 *  the standard Keyboard HID profile. It uses a HID parser for the HID reports,
 *  allowing for correct operation across all USB keyboards. This demo supports
 *  keyboards with a single HID report.
 *
 *  Pressed alpha-numeric, enter or space key is transmitted through the serial
 *  USART at serial settings 9600, 8, N, 1. On connection to a USB keyboard, the
 *  report items will be processed and printed as a formatted list through the
 *  USART before the keyboard is fully enumerated.
 *
 *  Currently only single interface keyboards are supported.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options

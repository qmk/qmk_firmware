 *  \section SSec_Compat Demo Compatibility:
 *
 *  The following table indicates what microcontrollers are compatible with this demo.
 *
 *  - AT90USB1287
 *  - AT90USB1286
 *
 *  \section SSec_Info USB Information:
 *
 *  The following table gives a rundown of the USB utilization of this demo.
 *

 *    <td>Host</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>USB Class:</b></td>
 *    <td>Communications Device Class (CDC)</td>

 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  CDC host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a USB CDC host, for CDC devices using the standard ACM profile.
 *  
 *  This demo prints out received CDC data through the serial port.
 *  
 *  Note that this demo is only compatible with devices which report the correct CDC
 *  and ACM class, subclass and protocol values. Most USB-Serial cables have vendor
 *  specific features, thus use vendor-specific class/subclass/protocol codes to force
 *  the user to use specialized drivers. This demo is not compatible with such devices.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>
 *     None
 *    </td>
 *   </tr>

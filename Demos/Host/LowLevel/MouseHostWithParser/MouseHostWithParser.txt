 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Mouse host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mouse host, for USB mice using
 *  the standard mouse HID profile. It uses a HID parser for the HID
 *  reports, allowing for correct operation across all USB mice. This
 *  demo supports mice with a single HID report.
 *  
 *  Mouse movement and button presses are displayed on the board LEDs.
 *  On connection to a USB mouse, the report items will be processed and
 *  printed as a formatted list through the USART before the mouse is
 *  fully enumerated.
 *  
 *  Currently only single interface mice are supported.
 *

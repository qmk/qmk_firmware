 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Keyboard host demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Mouse keyboard, for USB keyboards using
 *  the standard keyboard HID profile.
 *  
 *  Pressed alpha-numeric, enter or space key is transmitted through the serial
 *  USART at serial settings 9600, 8, N, 1.
 *  
 *  This uses a naive method where the keyboard is set to Boot Protocol mode, so
 *  that the report structure is fixed and known. A better implementation
 *  uses the HID report parser for correct report data processing across
 *  all compatable mice with advanced characteristics, as shown in the
 *  KeyboardHostWithParser demo application.
 *  
 *  Currently only single interface keyboards are supported.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>INTERRUPT_DATA_ENDPOINT</td>
 *    <td>Makefile CDEFS</td>
 *    <td>When defined, this causes the demo to enable interrupts for the data pipe,
 *        which services reports from the device. If not defined, the data pipe is
 *        serviced via polling using the task scheduler.</td>
 *   </tr>

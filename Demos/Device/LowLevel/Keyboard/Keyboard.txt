 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Keyboard demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a USB Keyboard using the basic USB HID drivers in all modern
 *  OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). It is boot protocol compatible, and thus
 *  works under compatible BIOS as if it was a native keyboard (e.g. PS/2).
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function as a keyboard
 *  when the USB connection to a host is present. To use the keyboard example,
 *  manipulate the joystick to send the letters a, b, c, d and e. See the USB HID
 *  documentation for more information on sending keyboard event and key presses. Unlike
 *  other LUFA Keyboard demos, this example shows explicitly how to send multiple key presses
 *  inside the same report to the host.
 *

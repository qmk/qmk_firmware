 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Joystick demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Keyboard device, for USB Joysticks
 *  using the standard Keyboard HID profile.
 *  
 *  This device will show up as a generic joystick device, with two buttons.
 *  Pressing the joystick inwards is the first button, and the HWB button
 *  is the second.
 *  
 *  Moving the joystick on the selected board moves the joystick location on
 *  the host computer.
 *  
 *  Currently only single interface joysticks are supported.
 *

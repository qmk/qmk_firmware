 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Dual LUN Mass Storage demonstration application. This gives a simple
 *  reference application for implementing a multiple LUN USB Mass Storage
 *  device using the basic USB UFI drivers in all modern OSes (i.e. no
 *  special drivers required).
 *  
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function as an
 *  external mass storage device with two LUNs (separate disks) which may
 *  be formatted and used in the same manner as commercial USB Mass Storage
 *  devices.
 *  	
 *  You will need to format the mass storage drives upon first run of this
 *  demonstration - as the device acts only as a data block transport between
 *  the host and the storage media, it does not matter what file system is used,
 *  as the data interpretation is performed by the host and not the USB device.
 *  
 *  This demo is not restricted to only two LUNs; by changing the TOTAL_LUNS
 *  value in MassStorageDualLUN.h, any number of LUNs can be used (from 1 to
 *  255), with each LUN being allocated an equal portion of the available
 *  Dataflash memory.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.

 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>TOTAL_LUNS</td>
 *    <td>MassStorage.h</td>
 *    <td>Total number of Logical Units (drives) in the device. The total device capacity is shared equally between each drive
 *        - this can be set to any positive non-zero amount.</td>

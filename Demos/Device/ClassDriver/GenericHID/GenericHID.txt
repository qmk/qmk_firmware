 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Generic HID device demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a generic HID device, using the basic USB HID drivers in all modern
 *  OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). It accepts and sends up to 255 byte reports to
 *  and from a USB Host, and by default transmits the last sent report back to the host.
 *  
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function as a vendor HID device.
 *  When controlled by a custom HID class application, reports can be sent and received by
 *  both the standard data endpoint and control request methods defined in the HID specification.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *  
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.

 *   <tr>
 *    <td>GENERIC_REPORT_SIZE</td>
 *    <td>Descriptors.h</td>
 *    <td>This token defines the size of the device reports, both sent and received. The value must be an
 *        integer ranging from 1 to 255.</td>

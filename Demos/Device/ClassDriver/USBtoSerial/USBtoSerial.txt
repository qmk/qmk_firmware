 *
 *  - AT90USB1287
 *  - AT90USB1286
 *  - AT90USB647
 *  - AT90USB646

 *
 *  \section SSec_Info USB Information:
 *
 *  The following table gives a rundown of the USB utilization of this demo.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>USB Mode:</b></td>
 *    <td>Device</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>USB Class:</b></td>
 *    <td>Communications Device Class (CDC)</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr> 
 *    <td><b>USB Subclass:</b></td>
 *    <td>Abstract Control Model (ACM)</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Relevant Standards:</b></td>
 *    <td>USBIF CDC Class Standard</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>

 *  </table>
 *
 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Communications Device Class demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing
 *  a USB to Serial converter using the CDC class. Sent and
 *  received data on the serial port is communicated to the USB
 *  host.
 *  
 *  After running this demo for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this demo
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>BUFF_STATICSIZE</td>
 *    <td>RingBuff.h</td>
 *    <td>Defines the maximum number of bytes which can be buffered in each Ring Buffer.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *  </table>

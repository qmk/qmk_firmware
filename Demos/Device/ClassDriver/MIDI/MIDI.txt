 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  MIDI demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing the USB-MIDI class in USB devices.
 *  It is built upon the USB Audio class.
 *  
 *  Joystick movements are translated into note on/off messages and
 *  are sent to the host PC as MIDI streams which can be read by any
 *  MIDI program supporting MIDI IN devices.
 *  
 *  If the HWB is not pressed, channel 1 (default piano) is used. If
 *  the HWB is set, then channel 10 (default percussion) is selected.
 *  
 *  This device implements MIDI-THRU mode, with the IN MIDI data being
 *  generated by the device itself. OUT MIDI data is discarded.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options

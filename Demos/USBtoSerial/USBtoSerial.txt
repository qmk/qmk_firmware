/** \mainpage USB to Serial Converter Demo (via CDC-ACM class)
 *
 *  Communications Device Class demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing
 *  a USB to Serial converter using the CDC class. Sent and
 *  received data on the serial port is communicated to the USB
 *  host.
 *  
 *  After running this demo for the first time on a new computer,
 *  you will need to supply the .INF file located in this demo
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under
 *  Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other
 *  Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt
 *  CDC-ACM drivers.

# Default Wind X R1 Layout

This is the default layout that comes flashed on every Wind X R1. For the most
part it's a straightforward and easy to follow layout. The only unusual key is
the key in the upper left, which sends Escape normally, but Grave when any of
the Ctrl, Alt, or GUI modifiers are held down.

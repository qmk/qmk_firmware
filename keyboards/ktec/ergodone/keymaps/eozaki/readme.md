# ErgoDox EZ Based Configuration

## Changelog

* Aug 2018:
  * New custom L0 layout.
* Dec 2016:
  * Added LED keys
  * Refreshed layout graphic, comes from http://configure.ergodox-ez.com now.
* Sep 22, 2016:
  * Created a new key in layer 1 (bottom-corner key) that resets the EEPROM.
* Feb 2, 2016 (V1.1): 
  * Made the right-hand quote key double as Cmd/Win on hold. So you get ' when you tap it, " when you tap it with Shift, and Cmd or Win when you hold it. You can then use it as a modifier, or just press and hold it for a moment (and then let go) to send a single Cmd or Win keystroke (handy for opening the Start menu on Windows).

# Basic Clueboard 66% Hotswap Layout

This is the default layout that comes flashed on every Clueboard. For the most
part it's a straightforward and easy to follow layout. The only unusual key is 
the key in the upper left, which sends Escape normally, but Grave when any of
the Ctrl, Alt, or GUI modifiers are held down.

This uses `LAYOUT_66_ansi`, which is compatable with the `66_ansi` community 
layout.

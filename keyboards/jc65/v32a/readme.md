A 65% keyboard with RGB

The JC65 PCB actually has two revisions: A QMK native version, and a PS2AVRGB version. Jchan offered both PCBs as options during the M65-A Round 1 group buy, and were also available choices for the 65% acrylic case group buy.

These docs are for the PS2AVRGB version of the PCB. More info on qmk.fm

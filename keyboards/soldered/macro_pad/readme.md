Make your own Macro Pad! Soldered Macro Pad Solder Kit is a soldering kit which - when finished - turns into a functional macro pad! Using the pre-loaded QMK firmware, you can map the buttons to any custom function. Easily connect via USB-C. Soldered makes open source products for makers of all skill levels - so we thought to make a 'learn to solder' kit which leaves you with a functional result you can use in your day-to-day computing.

# emdarcher's keymap for the Navi10

This is my personal keymap for the Navi10, developed for the original Rev0 prototype. It uses Tap Dance extensively on the INSERT key to access different layers.

- Base Layer: 
  * Regular Navigation Cluster except for the INSERT key which is for tapping.
- Hold Insert -> Function Layer: 
  * Maps Volume Control on PgUp/PgDN, Pause/Scroll-Lock on Home/End (MacOS brightness), and Delete to Enter. 
- 2 Taps -> Media Layer: 
  * Has mappings for Audio control on MacOS using the arrow keys, PgUp/PgDn, and Delete.
  * Lights up the Central 3mm indicator LED.
- 1 Tap -> Control Layer: 
  * Binds the arrow keys as LCTRL + Arrow Key for use in changing workspaces in MacOS.
  * Lights the Pro Micro TX/RX LEDs. These are visible through the board if you use clear PCB mount switch bases.

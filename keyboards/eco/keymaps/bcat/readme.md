# bcat's Eco layout

This is a cute little 4x14 ortholinear keyboard. I've set it up using an
unsplit, ortho version of my [split 3x6 + 3 thumb
keys](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/layouts/community/split_3x6_3/bcat)
(Crkbd) layout, with the following changes:

* The alpha keys are separated by an extra two columns in the middle to provide
a little more hand separation, similar to a split keyboard.

* The top three rows of the extra middle columns feature navigation keys and
brackets/braces. I don't really use dedicated keys for these, but I had the
keycaps, so I figured I may as well put them there.

* I have a Left Alt and Right Super key on the bottom row just like my
[Lily58](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/lily58/keymaps/bcat).

* The two keys in each bottom corner are unbound, as is the 2U spacebar in the
center of the bottom row. These keys are too inconvenient to reach, and there's
nothing really useful to bind them to anyway.

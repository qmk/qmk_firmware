## Bootloader

How to enter bootloader (DFU):
* Short the reset-header (labled BL/RESET) on the back of the PCB for about 2 seconds for the keyboard to enter DFU. When in DFU, it's ready to flash the firmware. If using a APM MCU it will not automatically reset after flash. Simply short the reset-header for a very short time to just reset the PCB, alternatively unplug and repluck the USB-cable to the keyboard.

Alternative option if the firmware is already pre-flashed:
* Unplug your keyboard, hold down the Spacebar and B at the same time, plug in your keyboard and wait a second before releasing the keys. The keyboard will enter DFU and is ready to flash the firmware.

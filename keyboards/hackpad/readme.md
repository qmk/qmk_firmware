The `Hackpad` is a 4x4 numpad/macropad designed for the Arduino Day 2023 in Bayreuth in cooperation with the hackspace [Imagin√§rraum e.V.](imaginaerraum.de) and [Fablab-Bayreuth e.V.](fablab-bayreuth.de).
It supports 16 MX-style switches, an EC-11 rotary encoder, and per key RGB LEDs based on SK6812.

In v0.2 all necessary components are through hole components (except for an optional reset switch and RGB-LEDs), but the ProMicro protrudes out of the case.
In v0.3 this is fixed by moving some diodes to the bottom side. The bottom diodes however are SMD only.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Nico Stuhlmueller](https://github.com/ThePurox)
* Hardware Supported: ProMicro is supported in v0.2 and v0.3 of the PCBs
* Hardware Availability: PCBs can be found [here](https://git.imaginaerraum.de/Purox/Hackpad)

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 2 ways:

* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the top of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

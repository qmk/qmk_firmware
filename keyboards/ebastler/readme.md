I'm a hobbyist designing keyboards for fun. [My homepage](https://mpwr.xyz). All my personal keyboard projects are open source and can be found in my github repos, linked below. Commissions may remain closed source.


* [isometria<sup>75</sup>](isometria_75) - 75% ISO-only board with rotary encoder, RGB underglow and single color backlight. [Github repo](https://github.com/ebastler/isometria-75).

* [E80-1800](E80_1800) - drop-in replacement PCB for the Cherry G80-1800. Requires minor case modifications, but adds backlight, native USB-C and (obviously) QMK. [Github repo](https://github.com/ebastler/E80-1800).

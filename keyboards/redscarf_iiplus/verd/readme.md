# Red Scarf II+ Ver.D (RS78)

A 60% keyboard with a numpad on the right

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Andy Lee](https://github.com/alittlepeace)
* Hardware Supported: Ver.D (RS77)
* Hardware Availability: [Drop](https://drop.com/buy/red-scarf-ii-plus-ver-d-custom-mechanical-keyboard-kit)


Please note that QMK Firmware does not currently support controlling the underglow LEDs; however, if your board came with the remote, it can still be used to change the colour.

## Flashing

The flashing is sub-optimal. 

Flashing the Red Scarf involves using Google Chrome, downloading an extension, and then flashing. For more detailed instructions please refer to [kairyu.gitbooks.io](https://kairyu.gitbooks.io/red-scarf-ii-plus-user-guide-how-to-custom-layout/content/online_reflash.html)

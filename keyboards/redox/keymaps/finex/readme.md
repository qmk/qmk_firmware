# Customized keymap for Redox by Leonardo (FiNeX) Finetti.


## Features

- PC Layouts: Colemak Mod DH-MK, Qwerty.
- Mac Layouts: same as above with CTRL-GUI keys inverted.
- Added redundant `Space`, `Esc`, `Ctrl` and `Enter` keys. I like to have this
  keys on both halves.
- Added macro to print `->` and `=>` strings.
- Added macro to print `:-( ` and `:-) ` strings.
- Added more arrows.
- Added `(` and `)` on Shifts keys.
- Tapdance: `:` (`;` × 2), `{` (`[` × 2), `}` (`]` × 2).
- Removed Mouse and media support.
- Added missing "Print Screen" and "Menu" keys.
- Added missing "F11" and "F12" keys.
- Added `Alt` modifier on home row.
- Added `Shift other half` on home keys: this allows to shift the right half
pressing `t` on the left (or `f` using Qwerty), and the opposite pressing `n`
(or `j` for Qwerty layout).


## Description

This keymap use the default one with some changes to suit my needs. Mainly

number keys on the second row and adding other symbols and ``|´` dead keys for
accents.

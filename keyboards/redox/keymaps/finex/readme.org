* Customized keymap for Redox by Leonardo (FiNeX) Finetti.
This keymap use the default one with some changes to suit my needs. Mainly
having most used symbol on a separated layer copying the common symbols on the
number keys on the second row and adding other symbols and ~◌̀~ ~◌́~ dead keys for
accents.


* Features
- Enabled USE_SERIAL for Falba.Tech Redox keyboards.
- Layouts: Colemak DHm, Qwerty.
- Added redundant =Space=, =Esc=, =Ctrl= and =Enter= keys. I like to have this
  keys on both halves.
- Added macro to print =->= and ==>= strings.
- Added macro to print =:-( = and =:-) = strings.
- Added more arrows.
- Added =(= and =)= on Shifts keys (Space Cadet Shift).
- Tapdance: =:= (=;= × 2), ={= (=[= × 2), =}= (=]= × 2).
- Removed Mouse and media support.
- Added missing "Print Screen" and "Menu" keys.
- Added missing "F11" and "F12" keys.
- Added =Alt= modifier on home row.
- Added =Shift other half= on home keys: this allows to shift the right half
pressing =t= on the left (or =f= using Qwerty), and the opposite pressing =n=
(or =j= for Qwerty layout).

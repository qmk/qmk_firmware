This keymap is **a work in progress**, and is meant to be used on macOS, with the "Unicode Hex Input" keyboard input.

I may change a lot of the keys over the next few months, and will update this repo when I do so.

## Layers

My keymap uses 5 layers:

1. The default base layer, using [Colemak](https://colemak.com/).
2. A Symbol layer, so all symbols can be accessed from the home row. (top right legends)
3. A Navigation / Media layer, with both sound control and arrows on the home row. (bottom right legends)
4. An international / Emoji layer so I can type accented characters commonly used in France and in Hungary, as well as a few Emoji I often use. (top center legends)
5. A keyboard control layer, not pictured above, allowing me to control the LED lighting as well as the keyboard debug functions.

# IFo Hancroft's ErgoDash Layout

 - Layer 1: A standard ANSI QWERTY layer.
 - Layer 2: A function layer. It contains just the F1-F12 keys.
 - Layer 3: A mirror of the right hand part of Layer 1, on the left hand, so I don't have to get my hand off the mouse when in CAD.
 - Layer 4: An empty layer in-case I need something on-the-fly so I can remap with VIA.

This keymap also sets the polling rate of the keyboard to 1ms, disables the EXTRAKEY feature, and enables the following features:

 - COMMAND
 - NKRO (forced on)
 - VIA

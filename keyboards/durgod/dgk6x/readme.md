### Initial Flash

For first Flashing from initial Stock's Firmware

1. Back up original Firmware Image:
- Unplug
- Short Boot0 to Vdd (See below)
- Plug In USB
- Make a Flash Image's Backup in case you wanted to restore the Keyboard to Stock's Image:
  - Using dfu-util:

        dfu-util --list
        dfu-util --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 --upload ${OLD_STOCK_BIN}

2. Flash the QMK Firmware Image.
- Put board into Bootloader mode, using the same method as when backing up the original Firmware (above)
- Here are a few options for performing the initial Flash:
  - Using [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox)
  - Using dfu-util:

        dfu-util --alt 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 --download ${NEW_QMK_BIN}

You can short Boot0 to Vdd by shorting R19 to C30 on the sides closest to the processor, as shown:

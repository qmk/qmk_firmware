# The default keymap for Durgod Galaxy.

Currently only supports ANSI

This keymap is intended to closely follow the stock Durgod Galaxy layout. RGB Hue and Saturation can be changed Fn1 + Fn2 + arrow keys. 

## Windows key lock

You can hold down Fn1 + Windows key to disable the Windows key while in locked mode.
The 'Lock' LED indicates if the Windows key is locked.

This is similar to the stock Galaxy Windows key lock functionality.

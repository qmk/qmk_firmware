The default keymap for ISO HS60 V2
==================================

![Layout image](https://i.imgur.com/NEtFQcV.png)

Default layer is normal ISO for windows. Second layout is Windows ISO layout but for OSX, but with the keys corrected so you will get the correct shifted and alt'd keys on OSX (keyboard keys match OSX keys without having to change your keyboard type in system preferences).  Layer three is configuration and other functions, and layer four is where the shifting magic happens.  Also tab and caps lock have been swapped around.

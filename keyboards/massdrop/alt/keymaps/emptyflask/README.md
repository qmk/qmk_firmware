### Drop (Massdrop) ALT Layout

This layout is for the [Drop ALT Keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-alt-high-profile-mechanical-keyboard).

Features:

* Tap caps lock for ESC, hold for CTRL
* Prefer grave/tilde to dedicated ESC key
* Swap home and delete. It's more compatible with my keycaps, and closer to a traditional layout.
* Numpad layer (FN-\ to enable)
* Method for clearing all stuck-down mods (taken from favorable-mutation, for tapped modifiers)

To do:
* Customize RGB: solid colors by default, highlight numpad keys when using that layer.

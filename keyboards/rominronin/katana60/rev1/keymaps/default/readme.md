# The default keymap for katana60

This layout takes my own personal layout (in development at the Colemak forum) and remaps the keys and shortcuts for Windows (I'm a MacOS user).  
The testing was comducted on my Windows gaming PC, though it was not exhaustive, all the many layers and useful navigation shortcuts worked fine.

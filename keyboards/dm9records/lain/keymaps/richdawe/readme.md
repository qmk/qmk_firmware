# The default keymap for lain

## Leds setting
1: CAPS LOCK
2-3: Layer indicator

## Changes from default layout

- Tab and ESC swapped - Tab next to Q, ESC next to A (where Caps Lock usually is)

TODO:

make the spaces mod-tap, shift on hold
MO(1)/MO(2) plus backspace should be delete
round brackets on [] MO(1) and MO(2)
numbers/symbols on wer-sdf-xcv block, with bits next to it like UT47.2 one

# richdawe keymap for Lain

## Leds setting

```
1: CAPS LOCK
2-3: Layer indicator
```

## Changes from default layout

There are too many changes to list here. I tried to change the layout in a way that felt natural to me. I put Tab next to Q, and moved Esc next to A. Tab next to Q is so engrained, that it's easier to move Esc.

Also, like on many of my kemaps, I've changed the key combination to enter the bootloader. Press the top-left key plus bottom-key together. I prefer an explicit combination than holding e.g.: escape when inserting the USB cable.

```
qmk compile -km richdawe -kb dm9records/lain
qmk flash -km richdawe -kb dm9records/lain
```

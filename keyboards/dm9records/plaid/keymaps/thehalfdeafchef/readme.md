# The Half Deaf Chef Plaid Layout

Opinionated keymaps optimized for programmers. The Left and Right Shift tap as parenthesis and the bracket keys are to either side of the layer keys (LOWER, RAISE). A 'right-side' up number pad in a layer with a complementary 'symbol' pad on the opposite side. An additional layer is provided to switch to virtual console on Linux based systems running xorg. These changes are propagated among all the layouts.

# Gipsy keymap for plaid

This layout is based on my corne layout:
* QWERTY with Tab, Backspace on top, dash and equals on the bottom.
* RAISE has numbers on top, arrows on hjkl, end/home on F/G, symbols on the
  bottom and around.
* XMONAD has xmonad wm key bindings, should be used with Layer modifier LGUI
* LOWER has F keys and shouldn't be used much.
* Thumbs are: XMONAD, Left SC shift, Space, Enter/Raise, Right SC shift

Does not have so many modtaps, basically just on enter.

The LEDs of the plaid keep blinking in a soothing dance, reminiscent of some
old machine.

When any layer is active, the LEDs are "startled".

There is an autoclicker for minecraft.

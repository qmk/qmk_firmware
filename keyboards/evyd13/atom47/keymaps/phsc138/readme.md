# PHSC138's Layout for the atom47
## Base layer
The base layer is a standard vortex core layout

## Layer 1 (PROG)
This layer contains space cadet bindings to make programming easier. Ex: tapping left shift will input an open parenthesis

## Layer 2 (GAME)
This layer contains game specific macros, currently only a D20 has been implemented

## Layer 3 (FN)
This can be activated by pressing the `fn` key. This layer contains mostly the same bindings as the base vortex core except vim keybinds have replaced the arrow keys.

## Layer 4 (FN1)
This can be activated by pressing the `fn1` key. This is the default vortex core layer.

## Layer 5 (NUM)
This is a numpad that can be activated by holding the PN key. This also has some useful keys, such as `QC_BOOT`.

## Bootloader

The PCB is delivered with a forked version of QMK.  
At this moment it is not apparent if the stock firmware comes with a keybinding for entering the bootloader.

Enter the bootloader with the stock firmware:

-   **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB

After flashing it is possible to enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

-   **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the escape key and plug in the keyboard
-   **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB
-   **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

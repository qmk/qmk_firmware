# Hardcore AI keymap for the vim clutch

The two enclosure tactile switches change between different ways of using the vim clutch.

The first vim clutch mode uses the `ESC` and `a` keys to clutch into and out of vim.

The second vim clutch mode uses the `ESC` and `i` keys to clutch into and out of vim.

These different modes can be combined with shift when using vim to jump to the end or the beginning of a line.  The first mode with `a` jumps to the end.  The second mode with `i` jumps to the beginning.

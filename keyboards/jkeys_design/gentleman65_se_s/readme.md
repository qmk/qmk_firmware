The Gentleman 65 Suited Edition aims to provide high levels of customization, unique features, and end game quality all at an accessible price. The board features a burger top mount for plates and an option for plateless mounting on soldered PCBs. The rear exposed brass weight and the knob add to the board's premium and minimalistic aesthetic, while the board's sound profile is accentuated with precut tape PCB backings.

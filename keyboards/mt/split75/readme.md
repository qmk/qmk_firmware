This is a port of the QMK firmware for the split75 keyboard, also known as the ve.a taobao split clone. It runs on
ps2avrGB firmware, like the [ps2avrGB keyboard](https://www.keyclack.com/product/gb-ps2avrgb/) or the ones sold
by [Winkeyless](http://winkeyless.kr/product/ps2avrgb-parts/).

Original work performed by Michael L. Walker, all credit goes to him. I've tidied up the keymap (removed 3 extra keys), a couple of functions, info.json and this Readme.

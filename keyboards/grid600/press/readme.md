# Grid 600 Type 05 "PRESS" Cover Module

Cover module for Grid 600 Keyboard with 4 keys.

Code for the module was originally located at [gridishere's QMK fork](https://github.com/gridishere/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/grid/gridmod5).  

Please keep in mind that this is actually a separate keyboard from the one installed in the Grid 600. 
Functionality such as layer changes and light modifications triggered on one PCB will not affect the other.

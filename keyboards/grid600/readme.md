#  Grid 600 Cover Modules

The Grid 600 is a tray mount 60% case supporting most standard 60% PCBs. 

A unique feature of the Grid 600 is that it has five different cover modules that not only include USB C pass through, but also have functions such as RGB or additional macro keys. 

This is a collection of some of the programmable modules available for this enclosure.

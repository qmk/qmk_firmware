# Bliss for Hotdox

This keymap for the ergodox hotdox is a take on a development setup I quite
enjoy. Developers constantly use brackets and they should therefore be
accessible instead of hidden away behind a shift key. Also this setup aims to minimize hand travel with a layer containing a numpad as well as arrows. Finally,
this setup incorporates a dynamic macro recorder for an easy, software agnostic way to program macros.

All keybinding diagrams can be read in the `keymap.c` file. It is quite well documented.

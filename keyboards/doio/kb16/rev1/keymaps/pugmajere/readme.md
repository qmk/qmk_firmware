# pugmajere's Google Meet optimized version of the default keymap

A lightly modified version of the default keymap.

The top row is converted to keys used for muting audio and video in
Google Meet, in both Linux and MacOS. (Yes, they annoyingly have
different conventions.)

The ASCII-art depiction uses "C-E" to mean "ctrl-e", and "M-E" to mean
CMD(GUI) and "e", roughly following Emacs naming conventions.

ToyKeeper's Whitefox Layout
===========================

A relatively straightforward 65% "truefox" layout with some extras.

## At A Glance

This is how the layout looks with all layers combined into a single image:

## Core Features

Most of the features are shared by all my keymaps.  Check my
[user dir](../../../../../users/toykeeper)
for the details.

Everything below is specific to this particular model of hardware.


## Hardware-Specific Notes

Things which differ from other models:

  * There are only 2 modifier keys to the right of the space bar, so the
    GUI/Alt key also doubles as a MouseLock key.  Hold for GUI, tap once for
    one-shot Alt, tap twice for MouseLock, tap 3+ times and hold the last press
    to hold Alt.

  * There is a dedicated Grave/Tilde key.  This could probably be utilized
    better, but for now it's just a normal key.

  * No RGB.


## Known Issues

None at the moment.

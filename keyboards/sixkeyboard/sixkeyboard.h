// This macro is an example of using a non-standard row-column matrix. The 
// keyboard in question had 11 rows and 8 columns, but the rows were not all 
// horizontal, and the columns were not all vertical. For example, row 2 
// contained "Print Screen", "N", "M", ",", ".", "/", "Right Shift", and
// "Left Alt". Column 0 contained "F6", "7", "O", "'", "Q", "D", "B", 
// "Left Alt", "Up Arrow", and "Down Arrow".
//
// The macro makes programming the keys easier and in a more straight-forward
// manner because it realigns the keys into a 6x15 sensible keyboard layout 
// instead of the obtuse 11x8 matrix.

# Winkeyless

[Winkeyless](https://www.winkeyless.kr) is a Korean keyboard company popular for creating the Boot Mapper Client (BMC) firmware. 

Winkeyless used an atmega32a MCU, mini USB B, and utilized the same MCU pins across all their PCBs. Their reset button was always
tied to pins `A0` and `B0` on the atmega32a MCU. 

Most Winkeyless boards were low profile and constructed out of acrylic showcasing their RGB underglow capabilities. 

In late 2018, Winkeyless closed its doors. The numerous unlicensed implementations of its hardware and software were cited as one
of many reasons for shutting down. 

This directory contains official Winkeyless boards that have had QMK firmware and VIA support added.

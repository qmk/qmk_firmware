My layout using the winkeyless b.face X2 PCB. The keys indicated with a gray color was not supported by the layout so a custom one was made.

### Building & Flashing

- Hold <kbd>LCTRL</kbd> while connecting to put in flashing mode
- Follow instructions in the main _bface_ directory

### Layout notes

The two additional keys were on pins 22+41 and 22+42, C3+B1 and C3+B2, which is mapped to col 10 row 1 and col 10 row 2 in the matrix.

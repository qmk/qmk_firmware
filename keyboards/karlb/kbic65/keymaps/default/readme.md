# Default KBIC65 Layout

This is the default layout for the KBIC65, it is recommended that you create your own keymap tailored to your specific needs. It is an ANSI keymap but uses the full KBIC65 layoutm, i.e., includes ISO backslash and split backspace but these are set to no action in this default layout. The layers are based on the KBDFans 67 rev 2 default keymap.

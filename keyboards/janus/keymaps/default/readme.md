# Janus Default Keymap

![Janus default keymap image](https://i.imgur.com/7FevUIZh.png)

The default Janus keymap is simple and organized. The only QMK special features used are layers and one shot keys for modifiers.

It is inspired by [Callum's keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/callum), with a few differences:

* Modifier keys are moved to the bottom row on every layer, and are mirrored on both sides.
* Symbol layer only contains non-shifted symbol keys.
* General differences in key positions.

For simplicity's sake, the keymap uses QMK's native one shot key implementation. There are other excellent one shot implementations out there, including Callum's in the aforementioned keymap.

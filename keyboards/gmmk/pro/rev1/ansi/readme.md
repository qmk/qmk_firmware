## Case Screw Replacements

Many users report stripped case screws when disassembling the board.

The stock case screws are:
* Thread: M2
* Thread length: ~5 mm
* Head diameter: ~3.8 mm
* Head counterbore diameter: ~4.0 mm
* Head counterbore depth: ~1.9 mm

Most M2x5mm screws should fit fine, although it's best to ensure that the screw head will fit inside the counterbore.
For reference, [this hex socket head screw](https://www.mcmaster.com/91292A005/) from McMaster-Carr should fit nearly flush (head will protrude above the counterbore by ~0.1 mm).

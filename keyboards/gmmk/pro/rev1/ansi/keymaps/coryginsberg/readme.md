# Description
Mac and Windows profiles with special touches for the Mac profile.

## Windows Profile
Should be nearly identical to the default profile for GMMK Pro. Only major difference is the button next to F12 is now PrintScreen and clicking the rotary dial switches profiles instead of muting.

## Mac Profile
Besides the usual swapping of the alt and windows/cmd placement also changes the following:
* Double press shift to activate caps lock
* Capslock is escape
* Button next to F12:
    * 1 press: play/pause
    * 2 presses: skip
    * 3 presses: previous
* Clicking Rotary Dial switches profiles

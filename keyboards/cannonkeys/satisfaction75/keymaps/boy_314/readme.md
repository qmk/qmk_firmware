# Boy_314's Satisfaction75 Layout

This is Boy_314's Satisfaction75 Layout. It can be used on VIA. It features a QWERTY layout on the base, along with missing TKL keys on layer 1. Right side 3 keys from top down are: Home, End, Delete. The encoder resolution has been reduced from the default of 4 down to 2 so that it no longer needs to click twice, but now only once, before triggering an action.

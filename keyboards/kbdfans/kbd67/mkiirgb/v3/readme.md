# KBD67 Mk.II RGB V3 (Hotswap)

A hotswap 65% keyboard with USB C, inswitch RGB, and ESD protection.

Originally sold as a replacement to the V2 as it offered a much simpler firmware flashing experience for customers. This board expects `.bin` files.

As of 10/2021 this board has no visible markings differentiating it from the previous V2.

It has since been sold with the KBD67Lite R2, D64, and Blade 65.

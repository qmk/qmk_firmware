Replay/camera tool for iRacing.  This uses the default keybindings for the game so nothing should need to be mapped.  This makes replays much easier to view in VR and makes waiting through heats a lot more enjoyable.

To make full use of the arrow keys open the camera tool (you can close the UI after) and optionally switch the AIM to static.

The code to generate stl files for the keycap set are ![available here.](https://github.com/AaronVerDow/KeyV2/blob/numpad/src/layouts/numpad/iracing.scad)

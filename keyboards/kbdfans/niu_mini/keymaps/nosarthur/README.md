# Kbdfans Niu Mini

Here `keymap.c` is generated by [qmk configurator](https://config.qmk.fm) and
it corresponds to the colemak-dh layout.

To customize, upload the json file to qmk configurator

- `keymap_colemak_dh.json`: colemak-dh layout
- `keymap_qwerty.json`: qwerty layout

Make the modification via the web interface, "compile" and download "keymap only".
Then place the generated `keymap.c` in this folder.

To flush the firmware, connect your keyboard and run

```
make niu_mini:nosarthur:dtu
```
in the `qmk_firmware` source folder.
There will be some prompts saying no device is found. Click the reset button in
the back of your keyboard and it should work.

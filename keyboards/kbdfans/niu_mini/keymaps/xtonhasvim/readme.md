# Xton has a tiny keyboard! With Vim!

Based on the standard Planck layout with a few changes:

* Escape moved to dual-function with control.
* Dedicated movement and mouse layers.
* Top and middle row swapped in `_RAISE` and `_LOWER` because I never use F-keys.
* Vim layers! See `users/xtonhasvim`.

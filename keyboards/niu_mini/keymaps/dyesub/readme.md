# Dye sub layout

Simple layout based on the keycaps [DYE SUB](https://kbdfans.com/collections/oem-profile/products/40-layou-dye-sub-keycaps) from KDBFans.

## Notes
- There is a different ESC key position in this layout.
- The mouse key, backlight and console for debug are disabled (Enable them by just modifying the `rules.mk` file).

/* Created 2021 by Sono-Gomorrha using kbfirmware.com and https://noroadsleft.github.io/kbf_qmk_converter/
 * This is essentially an interpretation of the macropad designed by Ryan Bates as presented here: http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/macro-keyboard-v2-0
 * As I did however wanted to make somthing with QMK and high shipping was in the way of ordering his PCB to Europe, I basically took the keylayout, designed a 3D printed case around it and handwired the whole thing together

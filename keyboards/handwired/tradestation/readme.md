A 4x4 ortholinear macropad, with options for 2U keys on the bottom half. Can be built as single PCB with custom case, or as two-PCB style with standoffs. Requires a Pro Micro.

This PCB supports an overall 4x4 matrix with unique spacing.

* Top two rows are 1U keys with 1/8U spacing
* Bottom two rows are available with 4x2 1U as clusters of 2x1U or as 2x2 2U, spaced with 1/4U

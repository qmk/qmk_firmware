# Bluepill onekey

To trigger keypress, short together pins *B0* and *A7*.

This variant requires the uf2-stm32f103 bootloader to be installed. This can be downloaded from the [uf2-stm32f103 releases page](https://github.com/mmoskal/uf2-stm32f103/releases).

Double-tap reset to enter bootloader mode. Copy the built uf2 file to the device by dragging the file to the new USB disk.

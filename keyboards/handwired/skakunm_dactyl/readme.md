This is a variation of Dactyl, main idea is to have 3x5 + 5 keys arrangement, 5 keys for thumb and a minimal set of keys for other fingers. Also having 20 keys enables easy wiring of 4 rows (1 for thumb and 3 for other fingers) and 5 columns (5 buttons for thumb and 5 columns for other fingers). Hardware form factor is somewhat similar to the Moonlander, but smaller. It is designed to be 3D printed using a SLA resin 3D printer.

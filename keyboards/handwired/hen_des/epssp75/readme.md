# epssp75

Ergonomic PSeudo SPlit 75-key Keyboard. Desinged after two years of working with a [Truly Ergonomic CLEAVE Keyboard](https://trulyergonomic.com) and also inspired by the [Redox Keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard).
I am using and the [NOTED](https://neo-layout.org/Layouts/noted/) layout and the [ReNeo](https://neo-layout.org/Einrichtung/reneo/) software which offers additional possible key functions and layers.

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 2 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead

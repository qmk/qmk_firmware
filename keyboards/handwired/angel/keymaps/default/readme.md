# Hand-wire Angel

![Angel Layout Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamessa/Angel/master/attachments/handwire.jpeg)

The default layout for hand-wire Angel is Colemak-DHM with modifiers on the home row. I'd love to see how we can improve it.

The most enjoyable part besides soldering is poking the QMK configurations and test it on keybr.com. It's so much fun.

# Default Layout for DQz11N1G-DE

This is the layout corresponding to what the Maltron keyboard DQz11N1G-DE I
own came with (using the original pre-installed controller).  Note that this
differs from German Maltron layout as published on [Maltron's
website](https://www.maltron.com/germany.html).  Use the photo above as a
reference for the layout implemented here.

I did not find any official documentation about the the Function Lock key on
the original Maltron keyboards.  It seems that it implements some of the
features that are documented for the one-handed Maltron keyboards.  Most
keys don't send any keycodes at all when function lock is enabed.

We instead map some of the Quantum keycodes (mouse keys and audio control)
in the middle (keypad) section of the keypad, when Function Lock is enabled.

# Traveller

The Traveller is a variant on the atreus keyboard.
Like the Atreus, it is designed to be a good compromise between size and ergonomics.

Key differences are:
- An additional column for each pinky
- An RGB LED in the center to show the current layer
- More finger stagger, splay angle and contoured keycaps (F2 profile for space key).

You can make your own Traveller keyboard by using the openscad tools from the atreus repository, and adding a hole for the LED to shine through. 

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/traveller:default

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make handwired/traveller:default:flash

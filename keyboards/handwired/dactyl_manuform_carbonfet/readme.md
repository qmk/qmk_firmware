* Hardware Supported: Pro Micro development board

## Variants

*Dactyl ManuForm Carbonfets* are built in variations that cater for different row and column counts, i.e. there is no default.

As standard, per half: 
- The finger keywell bottom row has 2 keys, 1 each in ring and middle columns
- The thumb cluster has 6 keys, arranged in a 2 row by 3 column arrangement. 

Variants are denoted as `RowCount`*x*`ColumnCount`*(_`Alteration`)*

| 4 | Three rows, typically for alphabet and some puncuation characters, with 2 key (finger keywell) bottom row |

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: If enabled, hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB or controller - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

# ABall

Your keyboard has plenty of buttons, why do you need more on your pointing device? ABall is a buttonless trackball designed to
fit nicely next to a kyria, or other keyboard which serves as the mouse buttons. For my use I have left, middle and right mouse
buttons on a layer along with keys for scroll up and down which I operate with my left hand while my right hand uses the ball for pointing.

Got this awesome buckling spring keyboard to work with a PC, it's really the cheapest way to try buckling springs :)

ATTENTION: I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE RIGHT SHIFT KEY IN THE KEYMAP BECAUSE IT SHARES THE CIRCUIT WITH THE LEFT SHIFT KEY SO YOU CAN'T CUSTOMIZE BOTH INDEPENDENTLY
I REPEAT, WHATEVER ACTION YOU ASIGN TO THE LEFT SHIFT KEY, THE RIGHT SHIFT KEY WILL DO THE SAME, SO IT WILL NOT APPEAR IN THE CONFIGURATOR OR IN VIA

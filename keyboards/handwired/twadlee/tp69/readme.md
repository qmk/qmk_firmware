# Twadlee TP69

![tp69](https://i.imgur.com/sC1qmJS.png)

A 69-key keyboard having a Trackpoint unit under an additional 70th keycap.

The layout is similar to a conventional 60% keyboard, but with additional 1u keys down a central split. The spacebar is also split, with the intervening space occupied by three mouse buttons and the left half replaced by a relocated `BACKSPACE` key. The right half of the spacebar is 2.25u. The space vacated by the `BACKSPACE` key is split into two additional 1u keys. The additional keycap on the home row does not cover a switch but a Trackpoint pointing device. All told, the 61 keycaps of the conventional 60% layout are augmented by an additional 9 1u keycaps, and a 2.25u keycap to replace the conventional 6.25u spacebar.

Given the unconventional layout, only non-sculpted keycap profiles are practical. I use DSAs.

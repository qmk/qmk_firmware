# Dactyl ManuForm Mini

The Dactyl ManuForm Mini is a fork of the [Dactyl ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard). The Dactyl ManuForm is a fork of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) with the thumb cluster from [ManuForm](https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm).

This [specific version](https://github.com/jceb/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard) of the Dactyl ManuForm Mini adds to additional keys to each side, CTRL and ALT, that are missing in the default configuration of the mini keyboard. In addition, a thumb cluster with 5 keys is enabled.

The keyboard is custom built and handwired. There multiple build guides available.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/dactyl_manuform/5x6_2_5:default

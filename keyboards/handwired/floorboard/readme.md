# Floorboard

I was too broke to buy the planck pcb, and I wanted the soldering practice. So here it is, in all it's glory. A handwired planck with a proton C, and the dvorak layout. Because why not. I named it the Floorboard as a callback to the planck, and because it's a couple of plays on words rolled into one.

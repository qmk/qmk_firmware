# Atlantis

A company that has been known to create some unorthodox and unique styled keyboard layouts, a great example of this is the AK82. The AK82 is a 60% layout with a numpad (numpad pictured commonly on the left, however a right side variant the AK82_VE exists).

Atlantis also produce some more traditional layouts like the AK81 a 75% layout (AK81_VE variant includes a rotary enconder) and a large range of macro pads.

Atlantis seem to be operating mainly out of Malaysia, products can be difficult to source internationally.

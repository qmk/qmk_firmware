# My personal layout for the JJ50

It is an approximation of a 60% layout with the alternate layers set up for programming,
with brackets and parenthesis on the homerow
Other things I changed were swapping around delete, backspace, and capslock around
It also uses layer based rgb underglow, and the underglow flashes when capslock is enabled

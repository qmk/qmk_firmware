## Default layer

Colemak, with fingers right up to the edge of the keyboard. Layers and capital letters are accessed by holding down keys on the bottom row of letters (so, holding down Z will give you the capitals, holding down the X will give you the number layer).

## Number layer

Used to access numbers (on the right hand side of the keyboard) and function keys (on the left hand side of the keyboard). Hold down X or > to access.

## Symbol layer

Used to access symbols. Hold down C or < to access.

## Navigation layer

Used to access navigation and RGB control keys. Hold down V or M to access.

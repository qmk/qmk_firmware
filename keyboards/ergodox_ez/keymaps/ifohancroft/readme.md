# IFo Hancroft's ErgoDox EZ Layout

- Layer 0: A QWERTY Layer.
- Layer 1: A Gaming Layer. It replaces the Backspace with a Space, and the Dash with a 6, so you can play CS:GO without needing to lift your right hand of the mouse.
- Layer 3: A Function Layer. It contains the F1-F12 keys, PgUp, PgDn, Numpad, arrows on HJKL and an NKRO toggle button.
- Layer 4: An Empty Layer. In case I decide I want some macros, or some other keys.


This keymap also does the following:

- Forces NKRO on
- Enables:
    - Via
- Disables:
    - Mouse Key
    - Extra Key

# IFo Hancroft's ErgoDox EZ Layout

- Layer 0: A Standard ANSI QWERTY Layer. It adds some additional keys from the right half in-order to avoid having to lift your right hand of the mouse.
- Layer 1: A Gaming Layer. It replaces the Backspace with a Space, and the Dash with a 6, so you can play CS:GO without needing to lift your right hand of the mouse.
- Layer 2: A Left Hand Layer. It is basically a left hand version of the right half, so you can have access to a full-sized keyboard without needing to lift your right hand from the the mouse.
- Layer 3: A Function Layer. It contains the F1-F12 keys, PgUp, PgDn, Numpad, and arrows on HJKL.
- Layer 4: A Layer Switching Layer. The keys in this layer turn on a specific layer while disabling the rest. Basically, you come here to switch between the QWERTY and Gaming layers.

# Gotham's Keymap for [Kyria](https://github.com/splitkb/kyria)
This is my personal keymap for Kyria with some mods. More information about the Kyria keyboard can be found [here](https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/introducing-the-kyria).

Code for encoders, oleds and thumbstick are used from userspace/gotham.

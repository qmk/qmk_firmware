# d4mation's keymap for the Atreus62

This is a bit of a work in-progress, but for the most part I like what I have done here.

I switched to Dvorak some time ago and software-based support in most OS's for Dvorak isn't very great, so this keymap by default is set to Dvorak.

## Table of Contents

* [Layers](#layers)
    - [Base layer](#base)
    - [Num](#num)
    - [Lower](#lower)
    - [Raise](#raise)
    - [Adjust](#adjust)

# Layers

## Base

* By default, this layer is Dvorak. But using the Adjust layer you can switch to Qwerty
* Double-tapping Shift enables and disables Caps Lock
* Quickly tapping the Grave accent key will output a Grave Accent, but holding it for 200ms will output the ESC key instead

## Num

This layer gets toggled off and on to place a numpad on both the left and right sides of the keyboard.

## Lower

This layer holds some handy shortcuts that I use often, like the screen grab shortcut and sleep shortcut in OS X.

It also has quick access to {} as they are inaccessible in the base layer

## Raise

Aside from quick access to [] and Play/Pause/Next/Previous, this layer is mostly just goofy things I decided to program into the keyboard because I could. There's a bunch of [kaomoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon#Japanese_style_(kaomoji))/"unicode smileys" and I added a toggle switch to enable a [Zalgo Text](https://zalgo.org/) mode.

## Adjust

This layer is a "here be dragons" layer. It can only be accessed by holding down the keys for Lower and Raise at the same time. I added exclusively keys that drastically transformed the keyboard's layout or function on this layer. The ability to switch to Qwerty is on this layer, a way to switch CTRL and CMD back and forth is on this layer, and a hotkey to enter bootloader mode also exists.

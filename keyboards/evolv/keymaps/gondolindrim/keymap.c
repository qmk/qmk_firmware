/* ---------------------------------------------- EVOLV75 GONDOLINDRIM LAYOUT
This is the firmware for the Evolv75 CE (pre-Alpha) PCBs as designed by Gondolindrim.

The final objective is to achieve a joystic encoder feature where the encoder can exhibit multiple behaviours, hereby called "encoder modes", which can be switched seamlessly by the user. In order to make the user know what encoder mode is active at a given instant, the keyboard has RGB underglow LEDs that shine a particular color; each mode has its own color.

Modes, their behaviours and their colors are user-customizable.

These delays define some important behaviours on the firmware.

MEDIA_KEY_DELAY is used throughout the code to hold certain keycodes for a time before holding them; this allows the use of media keys like volume up and down everywhere.

ALT_TAB_DELAY is the time delay the firmware holds the LALT key before letting it go; in practical use this means once you rotate the encoder in alt-tabbing mode, it will keep the alt-tab window held for this amount of time.

ENCODER_CLICK_DELAY defines a delayed behavior for the encoder click. Once you click it, a timer is triggered and monitored. If the click is held for more than this macro (defaults to 1000 or 1 second), encoder modes start cycling, each per second, and stops when you release. If you hold the click for shorter than the time defined in this macro, then the firmware registers the key contained in the .clicked_key list of that mode.

/* ---------------------------------------------- SPECIAL KEYCODE PROCESSING
	The heart of this firmware is the process_custom_keycode function; this allows all the customized keycodes ENCMUP, ENCMDN, ALTTABN, ALLTABP and so on to be used in any place including the encoder callback. Its main mechanic is calling the process_record_user function, where there is a function for each one of the customized keycodes.
	What process_custom_keycode does is, if a "normal" keycode is passed on, then it is registered and held for a small period of time (MEDIA_KEY_DELAY to be more specific). This "holding" allows it to correctly register media keys. However, if a custom keycode is used, then the function executes process_record_user again, but now with a new argument keycode that will be whatever is mapped inside the special key requested.
	Admittedly, this implementation looks redundant: process_record_user calls process_custom_keycode which calls process_record_user again. However, the ingenuity of this recursion is this allows any of the custom keycodes to be mappable both to encoder action as well as keys by having their behavior mapped to a single function in a switch-case structure. For instance, by having the encoder update function encoder_update_user use process_custom_keycode, the code for each custom keycode can be present in a single place in the code, that is, in process_record_user. On another hand, if the user wants to map a certain special keycode to a particular key, they can do so; for instance, if the user wants to map the encoder mode switch keys ENCMUP/ENCMDN to, say, left and right keys of layer 1, they can also do so.
	The glaring problem with this approach is the same as with all recursions: a recursion mapped to itself is a loop, meaning that it is very easy to put the program in a loop within process_record_user by nesting the custom keycodes, for instance, using the keycode ENCNTH in a north key in any of the modes. This then requires a certain care from whoever is adapting or customizing their encoder modes to not use ENCNTH, ENCSTH, ENCWST, ENCEST in the keymap or the encoder modes. The way the firmware deals with this is by only processing keycodes inside the 0x5F85 and 0x5F89 range which exclude these keys; if the given keycode is in the 0x5F80 to 0x5F84 range, which pertains to these forbidden keycodes, nothing is done; to the user it will seem like nothing happens.
	In the case of the encoder rotating action, in order to call process_record_user a placeholder record is used, the idea being to use values not obtainable phisically on the keyboard like col 20, row 20, with a timer right at the begginig of the code initialization.
keyrecord_t record {
  keyevent_t event {
    keypos_t key {
      uint8_t col
      uint8_t row
    }
    bool     pressed
    uint16_t time
  }
}

Despite this long description, process_custom_kc is fairly simple. It tests the passed keycode and, if it is one of the custom-defined keys in the forbidden range, nothing is done; if it's one of the good ones, process_record_user is called and the function for that particular keycode will be executed. In other cases, if the event was a press the keycode is registered and held for MEDIA_KEY_DELAY ms. In the case the event was a release, the keycode is unregistered.

/* ---------------------------------------------- PROCESSING ALT-TABBING
This function process the alt-tabbing keycode ALTTABS. The process works in a few steps:
- At first, the flag is_alt_tab_active is false. When the user first uses this keycode (rotating the encoder, for instance) then the function turns the flag and "presses" left alt (KC_LALT), also triggering a timer alt_tab_timer.
- The alt_tab_timer is supposed to keep track of how many miliseconds the alt-tab window should be kept, that is, how much time the LALT keycode should be held. The objective being, once the user cycles through the applications to the desired one, they select it either by not rotating the applications anymore or clicking the encoder.
- Finally, the function shoots out the KC_TAB keycode if the encoder was rotated clockwise or the S(KC_TAB) (shift + tab) if the encoder was rotated counterclockwise.
- If the user cycles the encoder still while alt-tab is active, then the function refreshes the timer and shoots out tab or shift+tab.
- The function that keeps track of the timer expiration is housekeeping_task_user, where if the alt_tab_timer surpasses the defined ALT_TAB_DELAY macro (defaults to 2 seconds or 2000 ms) then the release_alt_tab function is called: the LALT keycode is released and the is_alt_tab_active flag is set to false again
- The release_alt_tab function is also called when the ALTTABC keycode is hit, thus selecting the desired application.
*/

// This bool records if LALT is pressed or not. Due to the automatic disabling of the ALT-TAB of the ALTTABS custom keystroke, the automatic disabling can un-register KC_LALT even when the LALT key is phisically pressed. Hence there needs to be two bools: one that keebs track of the ALT-TAB activity and one that keeps track of LALT so that the automatic disabling will not disable LALT if it is phisically pressed.

/* ---------------------------------------------- DEALING WITH THE ENCODER CLICK
The encoder used in the Evolv has a construction particularity in that not only it has rotation and clicking but also directional joystic capabilities in the four cardinal directions, as in, it can also register four directions. The way that this works is, there are A,B and a common pin for the encoder rotation , with a PUSH and a COM pin. The encoder pins work pretty much like common encoders, as does the switch click: once you click it, PUSH and COM short-circuit, so the pushing mechanic can be easily integrated into a switch matrix and treated like a switch would.

The problem, however, lies in the directionals. For each directional, say N,S,W,E, there is a corresponding pin on the encoder; once one directional is hit its pin is shorted with PUSH and COM. This means that the directionals can be treated as four short-circuit keys and integrated into the matrix, but with the added hassle that every time one of them is registered, the encoder push is also registered.

The way this firmware deals with this problem is threefold.

- First, there is a is_click_blocked flag that is set true whenever one of the directionals is sensed by the matrix; the name suggests that in this case the click keycode processing should be "blocked". This allows the firmware to differentiate between an event where a directional was hit (the encoder push is recognized but is_click_blocked is true) and an event where only the push was used (is_click_blocked is false albeit the push being sensed).
- Second, in order to prevent the encoder push key from registering before the flag is set, a 20ms delay takes place when the encoder click was sensed; this means that when a directional is hit, the encoder action is guaranteed to be processed only after the is_click_blocked flag is true.
- Finally, held_click_timer and is_click_held are used to differentiate between a click short push and a long push; when a directional key is hit, is_click_held is immediately reset, further preventing any action corresponding to the encoder push click being held down.

automatic_encoder_mode_cycle is a flag used by the housekeeping function to communicate an encoder mode change was made during an encoder push, meaning that the user has held the encoder enough to trigger an encoder mode change. What the housekeeping function does is constantly monitor the timer so that, when it extrapolates the designated ENCODER_CLICK_DELAY, a mode change takes place; the held_click_timer timer is refreshed. The problem is that, once the user reaches their desired mode and releases the encoder, the timer had been refreshed and is lower than the designated delay, which would cause the "fast click" keycode to be triggered, which is of course unwanted. Hence the algorithm filters out these situations by knowing when the automatic mode change has taken place and not registering the click key, only resetting the automatic_encoder_mode_cycle flag.

Finally, the process_encoder_click function has two parts. In a click press event, it sets the flag is_click_held and triggers a timer. When the encoder push is released, the timer is sampled and the pertinent action is taken depending on how much time the encoder was held for.

/* ---------------------------------------------- HOUSEKEEPING
Housekeeping keeps track of three events:
- Keeps track of the alt-tabbing timer. If it surpasses ALT_TAB_DELAY the release_alt_tab function is called;
- Keeps track of the encoder click hold timer; if the encoder click is held for more than a certain delay, cycles encoder mode and sets the automatic_mode_change flag.
- The is_click_blocked flag marks if the encoder click has been registered with a directional key (recall that in this encoder, when a directional key is hit, both the directional key and the encoder push key are triggered in the keymap). In this case, only the directional should be registered. Hence, this housekeeping function resets the held_click_timer timer because, if this is not done, if the directional key is held for more than ENCODER_CLICK_DELAY then this will trigger an automatic mode change.

#+title: README

This is my configuration for the Lulu received as part of Boardsource's 2022 group buy.
Since I already have a few keyboards configured with QMK, I decided to swap out KMK.
Hopefully this helps others get started.

The base layer is colemak.

I use this keymap on both Linux and MacOS.
To keep muscle memory between the two as similar as possible, it takes advantage of QMK's boot magic keycodes.
The ~_FKEYS~ layer provides access to a Left Alt and GUI switch.
(I use LAlt with yabai on MacOS and GUI with Pop OS's tiling.)

# Gwillad keymap for prime e 
This is gwillad's keymap for prime e

Besides using a tweaked version of my prefered layout, this also includes:

* code to use the prime e leds for layers (instead of caps lock or num lock or anything else), which I thought made more sense on a 40%
* via enabled so people can still adjust their code without having to recompile

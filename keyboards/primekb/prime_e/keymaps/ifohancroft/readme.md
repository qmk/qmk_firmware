Will add layout image later when I get a KLE.

# IFo Hancroft's Prime_E Layout

 - Layer 1: A standard 45% ANSI QWERTY layer. It contains the alphabet, as well as a couple of special characters.
 - Layer 2: A function layer. It contains the number keys, the F1-12 keys, as well as the rest of the special characters that do not fit on Layer 1.
 - Layer 3: An empty layer in-case I need something on-the-fly so I can remap with VIA.
 - Layer 4: An empty layer in-case I need something on-the-fly so I can remap with VIA.

This keymap also sets the polling rate of the keyboard to 1ms, forces NKRO on, disables the EXTRAKEY feature, and enables the following features:

 - COMMAND
 - VIA

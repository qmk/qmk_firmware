## How to enter Bootloader Mode

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard.
We strongly recommend this method. If the PCB is not soldered with switches at the moment, use anything that's metal (twizzers for example)
to short the (0,0) position key ("ESC" in our PCB) while plugging the USB in. 

* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

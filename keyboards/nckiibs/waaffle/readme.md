Waaffle is an ortholinear keyboard that supports 60 key and 80 key layouts. The base PCB has a 60 key ortholinear layout, and it can be expanded to an 80 key ortholinear keyboard simply by adding an extension PCB. Waaffle features RGB underglow and on-board pinouts including a power switch and battery connection for a Bluetooth setup. Designed by dELIKEEb

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 2 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the top left key and plug in the keyboard. (If you built with an encoder in the top left, the "key" will be that encoder.) This will also clear EEPROM, so it is a good first step if the keyboard is misbehaving.
* **Keycode in layout**: By default, `QK_BOOT` is assigned to the top right key on the `ADJUST` (fifth) layer.

40% larger keyboard.  
The radial key layout allows you to place your hand in a natural position and move your fingers the shortest distance to type.  
Your iconic keys and keycaps can be placed in the center of the keyboard.  
It is possible to make it shine with LED backlighting.  
The keyswitches can also be replaced with MX sockets.

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the back of the PCB - some may have pads you must short instead
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available

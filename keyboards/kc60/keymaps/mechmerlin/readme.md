MechMerlin's KC60 Layout
======================

This is the 60% layout used by MechMerlin. It has 3 layers, base QWERTY, FN 1, and an arrows only layer.

## Keymap Notes
- Highly influenced by the KBP V60 and WKL B.Face standard layouts
- Does not support any form of inswitch or underglow lighting as Merlin hates them.
- Arrow toggle switch is FN + Space
- Rest is FN + R

# kubahorak's Keychron Q1 keymap

This ISO layout got heavily inspired by gtg465x's ANSI keymap (rev_0100).

Features:
- The rightest key column is: Ins, Home, PgUp, PgDn, which differs from the default.
- RGB lighting turns off when the computer sleeps
- Caps Lock and alpha keys turn red to indicate when Caps Lock is on
- When the Fn layer is active, RGB lighting turns off for keys that are not assigned

# The default VIA keymap for DC01 Left

Please use this for ISO as well.

The keymap looks like a full layout keymap.

This is because the left part of the keyboard acts as the masterm coordinating all four part.

When using the keyboard to connect the other three parts, this keymap overwrites the individual keymaps of the single modules.

When using a module individually, the keymap of that module will take effect.

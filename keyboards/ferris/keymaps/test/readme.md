# A test keymap for the Ferris keyboard

This keymap is not intended to be used to use the Ferris as a usable keyboard, but rather it is meant to be a very simple keymap used to test the hardware works properly. It can also be used to test firmware being written for new versions with a minimum amount of complexity coming from the keymap itself.

The keymap is composed of a single qwerty layer with a unique digit bound to each non-alpha key.

# Alper's Contra Layout

![Dvorak Layout](https://i.imgur.com/BvBYgpz.png)

## Rationale

I based this off the default and changed some stuff because I'm a macOS user who types in Dvorak:

* Ctrl/Tab: It is normal to remap Caps Lock to control there and having a press button there for Tab would solve a lot of problems. BUT on my Contra this button is broken, so I've mapped 0,0 to Tab as well.
* Shift/Esc: A standard left shift with an Escape that I have not been utilizing much in favor of the top corner button.
* Tab: The replacement tab.
* Overloaded the Left arrow with another GUI (Command) button because that is essential on macOS.
* Overloaded the Enter button with a Shift because like Command, it is essential for me to have these on both sides of the keyboard.
* Raise-0,0: Switches between windows of an application.
* Raise-0,1-2: Dedicated next and previous tab buttons since these key combinations caused a finger twister.


## TODO

* Try out tapdance for brackets (see ryanm101/keymap.c)
* REMAP ESC To LT() so I can use it to select numbers (_NUMB) and functions more easily? (see msiu/keymap.c) https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_advanced_keycodes?id=switching-and-toggling-layers
* Wipe everything except Dvorak and Qwerty (see deastiny/keymap.c)

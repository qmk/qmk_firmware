# IFo Hancroft's Idobo Layout

 - Layer 1: A standard ANSI QWERTY layer.
 - Layer 2: A fuction layer. It contains the F1-F12 keys, RGB control keys and the Insert and End keys.
 - Layer 3: An empty layer in-case I need something on-the-fly so I can remap with VIA.
 - Layer 4: An empty layer in-case I need something on-the-fly so I can remap with VIA.

This keymap also sets the polling rate of the keyboard to 1ms, the HUE, VALUE and SATURATION of the RGB to steps of 1, disables the MOUSEKEY, EXTRAKEY and CONSOLE features, and enables the following features:

 - COMMAND
 - NKRO (forced on)
 - VIA

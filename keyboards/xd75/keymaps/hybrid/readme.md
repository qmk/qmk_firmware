# My XD75 keyboard 
# The layouts are 100 % customizable by myself.
# The layout 1 is almost finished (layer 2 and layer 3 are not finished, for testing purpose as far)
# Layout 1 => rgb red
# Layout 2 => rgb green
# Layout 1 => rgb blue
# (to memorize => rgb :) )
#
# I added some double tap dance for french accent (à é è î ô ù, not for every accents) and c & ç 
# Some double tap dance for useful mapping (- & _ ,  ({[ & )}], etc...  )

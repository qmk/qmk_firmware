# XD75

This is a Colemak layout for XD75 with both Mac and Windows layers.
These two layers share momentary toggle access to a "Symbol" layer, which is modeled after my Planck layout (see planck/keymaps/davidrambo).
Each of the base Colemak layers have their own Navigation layers for the right hand to use arrows and shortcuts for both text editing and web browsing.

The rules.mk file overrides the XD75's "BACKLIGHT_ENABLE" with YES and also adds tap dance functionality.

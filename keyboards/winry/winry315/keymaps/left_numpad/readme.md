# The “Left Numpad” keymap for Winry315

This is a keymap example for the Winry315 board in the “left” orientation (the board is rotated so that the encoders are on the left side, and the keys are in 5 rows of 3 keys).  The `LAYOUT_left` macro is used for this orientation, and `WINRY315_DEFAULT_ORIENTATION` is redefined in `config.h` to change the behavior of RGB Matrix effects.

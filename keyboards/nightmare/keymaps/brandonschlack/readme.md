## Features
- Mod-Taps & Layer-Taps
  - Spacebar is used as a Fn button when held to access missing numrow and F-keys on the **RAISE** layer.
  - Holding `Tab` acts as `HYPER`, or `Shift+Control+Option+Command`. I use this set global shortcuts, such as `HYPER+w` for my **W**indow manager Moom.
- **Lower** Layer
  - `Lower+Esc` for `Delete`
  - `Lower+LShift` for `Caps Lock`. Holding `Lower+LShift` still acts as `LShift`
  - Arrow keys as `Lower+[`,`;`,`'`,`/` for `Up`,`Left`,`Right`,`Down`.
  - Media keys as `Lower+Enter`,`Home`,`End` for `Play/Pause`,`Next Track`,`Prev Track`
  - Volume controls as `Lower+]`,`Page Up`,`Page Down` for `Mute`,`Volume Up`,`Volume Down`

# J80

JER PLANT - J80 (JER-A06) Round 2
The J80 is a OG Cherry style(no plate) custom 80% kit.
It is characterized by the fact that the hoisting PCB has no steel plate and can fully reflect the elasticity of the linear shaft. Tested by the buyer, its feel and typing sound are different from other custom keyboards and are satisfactory. It has a simple and elegant original cherry-like shape, the author's original intention is to start from the touching feel, let everyone have a comfortable tapping experience. The light stick module in the upper right corner is detachable, it could be switches (3 keys) or the light stick module. When using light stick module, PrtScr Scrolllock and Pause are achieved by pressing FN+ Insert / Home / Page Up.

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the Escape key and plug in the keyboard (this one might be disabled on the stock firmware)
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the PCB, located under the space bar keycap, to the right of the space bar's switch
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available. On the stock firmware, VIA should allow it to be mapped.

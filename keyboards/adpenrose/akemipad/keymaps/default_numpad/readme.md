# The default_numpad keymap for the AkemiPad


## Features
- Audio Click and Music Mode capabilities.
- RGB Matrix Lighting (cycles left-right and up-down).
- Encoder Map feature.

### Disclaimer
The AkemiPad has multiple layout options (each one with its own LED positions), but this keymap does not take that into consideration.
If you want to select an specific layout (and see how the LEDs turn on and off accordingly), you
should use the [via keymap](../via).

**Note:** This setup has locking Caps Lock and Num Lock keys, so if you wish
to use this layout and do not have such keys, you should :

 - Change the keys `KC_LCAP` and `KC_LNUM` to `KC_CAPS`  and `KC_NUMLOCK` 
   respectively.
 - Remove the `LOCKING_SUPPORT_ENABLE` and `LOCKING_RESYNC_ENABLE` lines
   from `config.h`.

For any other questions, find my latest contact information on my github page.

Base Layer:

Uses a tweaked 60% ANSI layout with split right shift and up/down keys in the bottom right. Resulted from being used to 65% boards with arrow keys in bottom right and using the up/down arrows a lot in terminal.

- Page Up/Down, and Home/End have been mapped to the up/down keys on different layers.
- The Caps Lock Layer uses VIM style directions on HJKL keys.
- LGUI moved to Mac Command Key location
- FN2 layer that has arrows on IJKL for one-handed arrow key control.
- Added Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause keys on P,[,] keys to add Mac screen brightness control.
    * On Mac, Scroll Lock is Brightness Down and Pause is Brightness Up, so with this FN+[ = brighness down, FN+] = brightness up
- Has Mac Fast-forward and Rewind keys mapped for changing media tracks. FN+; = Rewind, FN+' = Fast-forward

# Default keymap for Sofle Keyboard

Layout in [Personal Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/71f70700d2b849ab36e34f58228cb38f) and [adjust layer](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/75ab0b7ff51d51435d98c186ef52d6b6)


Features:

- Layout comfortable for me.
- Based on Josef Adamicik default layout.
- Spanish keyboard with all keys I use to do my job, not more nor less.
- The OLED on master half shows selected mode and caps lock state and is rotated.
- Adopted Luna the cat, modified to cover a bug, no bark, instructions [here](https://github.com/HellSingCoder/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/sofle/keymaps/helltm)
- Left encoder controls volume up/down/mute (useful). Right encoder PGUP/PGDOWN (never used).
- Still testing.

## Bootloader and Flashing:
The keyboard can be flashed with new firmware by entering the bootloader in one of the following ways:
- Bootmagic reset: unplug the keyboard, press and hold the top left key, plug the keyboard back in, and then release the top left key
- Physical reset button: Remove the space bar and double press the reset button twice in short succession

Once the keyboard enters bootloader mode, it will present itself as a removable device called `RPI-RP2`. Copy / drag the new firmware file to the `RPI-RP2` drive to flash the new firmware onto the keyboard.

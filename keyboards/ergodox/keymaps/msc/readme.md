# MSC Configuration

### Based mostly on the ErgoDox EZ default layout with optimizations for coding on osx.

#### Expecting the user to rely on Coder Layer this keymap removes some of the duplicate symbol keys in the lower portions of the board and replaces them with arrow keys and modifiers. The Media Layer is also updated to match the change in the arrow keys and the left and right click buttons are moved under the thumb position. The Media layer is now reached with toggle button in the lower right.

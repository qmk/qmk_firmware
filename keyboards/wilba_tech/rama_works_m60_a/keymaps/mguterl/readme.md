# Michael Guterl's M60-A Layout

Check out my [userspace](/users/mguterl) for the custom keycodes that are used
in keymap.c.

This is a pretty standard HHKB layout. I add a couple of layers to add
some conveniences and add vimkeys for navigation.

If you flash a layout without RESET then you can unplug the keyboard, hold
spacebar and escape, and then plug the keyboard back. This sequence of
actions will allow you to flash the keyboard.

```sh
make wilba_tech/rama_works_m60a:mguterl:flash
```

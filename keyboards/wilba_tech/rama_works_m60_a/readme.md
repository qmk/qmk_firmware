# RAMA WORKS M60-A

The M60-A represents the benchmark and equilibrium between function and design for us at Rama Works. The gently exaggerated design of the frame is not understated, but rather provocative. Inspiration and evolution from previous models are evident in the beautifully articulated design and the well defined aesthetic, the fingerprint of our 'Industrial Modern' designs. The M60-A offers a unique contender in the traditional 60% form factor. [More info at RAMA WORKS](https://rama.works/m60-a/)

# For Science

![for_science](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peej/for-science-keyboard/master/pcb.png)

A split ergo 4x5 keyboard with 3 thumb keys where each half is smaller than the 100x100mm cheap PCB production size. 
Designed to be easy to build, it only supports serial communication over a TRRS cable and no LED support.
The PCB is reversible, meaning that you use the same PCB for both the left and right halves and thus need two PCBs to create a full keyboard.

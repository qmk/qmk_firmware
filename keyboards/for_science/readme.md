For Science
===========

A split ergo 4x5 keyboard with 3 thumb keys where each half is smaller than the 100x100mm
cheap PCB production size.

The goal of this project is to build a usable split keyboard with a PCB case within
the 100x100mm cheap PCB size limit offered by some PCB manufactuers. Designed to be
easy to build, it only supports serial communication over a TRRS cable and no LED
support. The PCB is reversible, meaning that you use the same PCB for both the left
and right halves and thus need two PCBs to create a full keyboard.

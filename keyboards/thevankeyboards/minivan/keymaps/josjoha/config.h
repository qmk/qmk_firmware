    //#define NO_DEBUG //disable debugging (already defined)
    //#define NO_PRINT JJdisable printing/debugging using hid_listen (already defined)
    //#define NO_ACTION_LAYER //disable layers (obviously need layers)
    //#define NO_ACTION_TAPPING // This saves 2516 bytes (9%) (keymap uses tapping)
    //#define NO_ACTION_ONESHOT // This did not reduse firmware size on 26 Jan 2020

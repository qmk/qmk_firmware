1 Overview
==========
_A layout for the demanding keyboard user (10 fingers / blind)._
Designed for intuitive key placement, more symbols than standard English
keyboard, speed and text size measuring.
*400%* _the capability in_ *40%* _the size_ (by key function count).

For some ‛common layers’ (numbers pad, movement), different versions
can be chosen than shown just below in this by layer view:

![Minivan illustration Overview layers](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan-all-layers-clear-visualization_1500_vf.jpg)

By key view:

![Minivan illustration Overview layers by key](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan-all-layers-clear-visualization-by-key_2000_vh.jpg)

1.1 Hardware compatibility
==========================
This keymap functions on _Minivan_ hardware variants with 44, 45 and
46 keys.

It may be fairly easily ported to 12x12x12x[11|12|13] keyboards.

1.2 Software compatibility
==========================
This keymap relies on Unicode, in an attempt to avoid the 
“dead key” system for accented characters on many non-English keyboards.
You need to have Unicode input working on your computer.

On a Linux computer operating system, this keymap is designed to work
with this keyboard/language setting:

        > setxkbmap -layout us
        > echo $LANG
        `en_US.UTF-8`

If that works for you, you can type the most important characters in
the western European group of languages, native from the keyboard.

This keymap might not function as expected if you want to use a
different keyboard language setting in your operating system.

See also chapter 6 _Language support_.

2 'make' example
================
     … Download the repository, resolve software dependencies etc..
     … To change compile options: edit user_config.h (or `minifan_config_compact.h`)
     > cd […]/qmk_firmware
     > make thevankeyboards/minivan:josjoha
     > su
     # dfu-programmer atmega32u4 erase
     # dfu-programmer atmega32u4 flash thevankeyboards_minivan_josjoha.hex
     # dfu-programmer atmega32u4 start

This “Mini*fan*” layout is explained in several readme files, with
links to the others files in this readme. The common system is explained
in this readme.md file. The options for the letters and number/symbol
layer pairs (two pairs in the dual layout) are explained in their
separate readme file, see immediately below. Compile options are detailed
in `./user_config.h`.

3 Base layouts
==============
Layouts are presented here in a sort of simplified keycaps view.  If a
base layer pair has its own user configuration options, they are located
in `./base_NAME.h`.

3.1 Normal layouts
------------------
These are layouts for commonly used configurations, such as Qwerty or Dvorak.

3.1.1 Qwerty
------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_qwerty_vc.jpg)

For the readme about the Qwerty version, see ➡ ![base_qwerty.md](./base_qwerty.md) ⬅

3.1.2 Qwerty with arrows on Base
--------------------------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_qwerty_basearrow_vd.jpg)

For the readme about this Qwerty variation, see ➡ ![base_qwerty_basearrow.md](./base_qwerty_basearrow.md) ⬅

3.1.3 Dvorak
-------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_dvorak_vc.jpg)

For the readme about the Dvorak version, see ➡ ![base_dvorak.md](./base_dvorak.md) ⬅

3.1.4 Dvorak² 
-------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_dvorak_descramble_vb.jpg)

Regular Dvorak for a computer already set to Dvorak.

For the readme about the Dvorak² version, see ➡ ![base_dvorak_descramble.md](./base_dvorak_descramble.md) ⬅

3.1.5 Colemak
-------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_colemak_vc.jpg)

For the readme about the Colemak version, see ➡ ![base_colemak.md](./base_colemak.md) ⬅

3.1.6 Workman
-------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_workman_va.jpg)

For the readme about the Workman version, see ➡ ![base_workman.md](./base_workman.md) ⬅

3.2 Special layouts
===================
These are unusual layouts. Most people will probably only want one of these on the ‛Alternate’ layout,
with a normal layout on ‛Default’. How this works is explained below.

3.2.1 Numbers pad
-----------------

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_numpad_single_va.jpg)

For the readme about the Numpad version, see ➡ ![base_numpad.md](./base_numpad.md) ⬅


4 The common system
===================

![Minivan layout impression](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_keycapview_common_vc.jpg)

4.1 Main features 
-----------------
     • Dual layout. Several layouts to choose from (example: Qwerty
       and Dvorak dual layout). Easy to add more layouts.
     • Expanded character set with western European accented characters
       (ëøßœç…); sub- super-script numbers (¹₂…) quite a few additional
       symbols such as 《 ± • ☑  ❦ √ ┣ ≠ 》…
     • Typing speed measuring. Led changes color with your speed. You can 
       ask for a report on your current and average typing speeds.
     • Text size measuring. If you want to type some amount of words or
       characters, the middle led will go from green to red as you go,
       and prevent you going over the limit.

4.2 Layer access
----------------
This graphic shows how layers are reached from the ‛Default base’ layer.

![Minivan layout Image associations](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan-default-base-layer-activation_1500_vf.jpg)

You can switch between the default base layer (typically letters), and
another base layer, the alternate base layer (also typically letters),
on the `_RAR` layer with key ‛Other Base’. Each base layer comes
with its own second layer, typically numbers-symbols. The other 
layers are used common between the default and alternate base layers.

The Base layers and their numbers layer are detailed in files beginning
with `./base_…` (links below).

                   Layer overview:                    Defined in:

        • Default Letters / Base                   ┓
        • Default Numbers-symbols                  ┃
                                                   ┣ ./base_….c/md files
              • Alternate Letters / Base           ┃
              • Alternate numbers-symbols layout   ┛

           • Numbers pad                           ┓
           • Accented characters                   ┃
           • Additional Unicode characters         ┃
           • More Additional Unicode characters    ┣ ./keymap.c(etc)/readme.md
           • Movement arrows/mouse                 ┃   “The common system”
           • Function keys / layer toggles         ┃
           • Power, media, Speed, Text size, etc.  ┛

There are some additional layer switching keys due to key transparency
artefacts, allowing for example to go back to ‛Base’ from a toggled `_MOV` 
layer with what is the ‛Enter’ key on Base.

     ³) 'South paw' hardware configuration. Configurable, default shown.
     ⁴) 'Arrow' hardware configuration  Configurable, default shown.
     ³ ⁴) There are two more optional hardware keys, to make it easier to compile for
          a 12x12x12x11 or 12x12x12x12 layouts.
     ⁵) Left Shift when pressed with another key. Medium long: to toggle _PAD. Long: toggle _MOV.
     ⁶) Right shift when pressed with another key. medium long: to toggle _FUN. Long: toggle _RAR.

Remarks: The left modifiers have a slight delay in combination with an outside pointer device (mouse, stylus).
It seems this will be difficult to fix, because it is spread over two devices. To avoid the
±0.2 second delay, activate a layer where the modifiers are direct (`_PAD`, `_MOV`), using the layer toggle on
left shift. 

The two keys with ';' (Del;`_ACC`, Right;`_RAR`) do not auto-repeat on double tap, like QMK normal layer-tap keys.

There is an uncluttered _Delete_ on `_PAD`, an uncluttered _Right_ arrow on the `_MOV` layer.

There is an uncluttered _Tab_ on both the `_DRA` and `_ACC` layers. They can be modified with _Control_ there.

Holding both `_..._NSY` keys left and right of the "split space bar" (enter, space) results in layer `_DRA`.

Holding either one of the just above mentioned `_..._NSY` layer keys (<3 and 3>), with the `_ACC` layer key
(on <2) results in layer `_BON`.

For the 'arrow' hardware layout (additional key on the right), keys on the first
row are sacrificed and lost. The right most key on the second row is also lost.
The two keys on places 3 and 4 when counting from the right on the second row,
are being moved to the spots for Btn2 and Btn3 on the hand that also has the 
arrows (those keys are otherwise twice defined for left and right hand).

Remarks. !Alter switches between normal and alternate Base layer.

☑ is a Unicode tester key. uLNX for Linux Unicode input encoding, uBSD
for BSD Unix, uWIN for Windos, uWNC for another Windos encoding. The
change is retained between on/off power cycles.

MLed switches on/off the middle led, SLeds switches on/off the side leds.

The keys marked with • require Shift to be activated, as a means of
preventing accidents. Shift here is on (Base) 'Backspace' (upper/right key)
which also reduces accidents (combinations which are never pressed
normally). If you press these keys without 'shift' they print their own
name between angled brackets. Example: pressing the 2nd key on the 3rd
row prints `“<POWER>”`.

Bri+, Bri-: screen brightness (if your system supports it.)

Speed: toggles speed measuring on/off. SRprt: writes your speed.
See topic about Speed measuring.

Cnt/Mx, Cnull CWmin, CRprt: text size measuring. See topic.

4.5 Movement layer options
--------------------------
The movement layer (`_MOV`) has several configuration options. You
can either have _triangle_ configuration arrows on the _left_ hand
(with navigation keys around it), or a _flat_ arrow configuration on
the _right_ hand (with navigation above it).

You can configure for the _arrow_ hardware layout (one additional hardware
key on the right). The additional key on the Base layer can toggle to the
movement layer, and than becomes part of the arrow cluster. For both
versions (_triangle_ arrows left hand or _flat_ arrows right hand) you
can compile this second arrow cluster to be completed with navigation keys
(Home, End, PageUp, PageDown).

      • keys like Power, Play,           Led: white/purple/purple ⁽⁴⁾        _RAR "RARe keys"

      Leds:
            • ⁽¹⁾ The low-white led is bright-white when capslock is on. Optionally the middle led (cyan) can
                  show the color of the last layer that was active.
            • ⁽²⁾ The colors are reversed blue/low-white/green when numlock is on. 
                  Left led color memory aid: same as either numbers or movement layer for numlock on/off.
            • ⁽³⁾ The colors are reversed to orange/red/red when set to de-activate after one F-key press.
            • ⁽⁴⁾ The colors are reversed purple/purple/white, indicating which of the two base layers
                  is active (see below).
            • Middle led: Breathing effect. When not breathing, keyboard is not working normally with the computer.
                        - When speed measurement is active, the middle led color indicates the speed, unless
                          text size counting set to a maximum is active.
                        - When text size counting is active and set to a maximum amount, the middle led color 
                          indicates progress to the limit from green to red, flipping white/red on the limit.
                        - When on Base layer it shows a teal color, or (compile option) the layer most recently active.
                        - When the left/right leds are off, when on Base, it shows a teal color (not last active), even
                          if so compiled.
            • Leds can be switched on/off on the _RAR layer (SLeds, MLed).


6 Compile options
=================
         Layout

 • Several layouts to choose from: Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, Workman, Numpad.

 • You can use the keyboard with two different letters/number-symbols layouts.

         Hardware

 • Hardware key configurations: _default_ (44), _arrow_ (45), _south paw_ (45), _arrow_ + _south paw_ (46).

![Minivan illustration 0](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan_illustration_arrow_southpaw.jpg)
   (On the `_RAR` layer, the additional _south paw_ key is more to the right.)

 • What the additional hardware keys for _arrow,_ _south paw_ should be.

         Navigation cluster

 • An arrow cluster for _arrow_ hardware configuration, on the `_MOV` layer.

 • All navigation keys around _arrow_ hardware configuration arrow cluster on `_MOV` layer.

 • Navigation cluster in a triangle (WASD) (left hand), or flat layout with optional vi(1) layout.

         Numpad (in common layers)
 
 • Numpad with numbers in a row.

 • Numpad with layers in a block form.

         Special functions

 • Set speed measuring on/off at keyboard startup.

 • Set text size measuring on/off at keyboard startup.

         Changing symbols

 • Switching the GUIs left/right, and some other specific key changes.  

 • Reduce firmware size/bloat: remove or eviscerate Unicode layer(s).

 For the complete list, see `./user_config.h`.

7 Language support
==================

7.1 Input methods
=================
There seem to generally be two ways in QMK for typing a language other than English.
One is to use a language specific remapping on the computer operating side, and
to use the QMK supplied symbols in the keymaps. This may include the use of a “dead key”.
Presumably you can also still use the Unicode symbols. 

⚠ *There are currently no such Base pair layouts available. If this is the method you want,
you may want to look elsewhere.*

The other way is to type the additional symbols in Unicode. _The computer
operating must understand these special sequences._  Several Unicode
input modes are available, which can be changed while the keyboard is
running. There is no need for a “dead key”.  The language setting
in the computer operating system can be set to English. This layout is
designed for this method, to avoid the dead key problem.

7.2 Unicode symbols
===================
For the remainder of this chapter the Unicode input method is assumed.

You may be able to type your language, with the help of some of the Unicode
layers and one of these layouts: Qwerty, Dvorak, Coleman, Workman. The following
languages might work for you this way. 

     • Dutch (éëèïĳí)
     • English (—“”‛’)
     • French (çœæéèàòùîûêôâëïüÿ)
     • German (äöüß)
     • Norwegian, Danish (œæøå, éêèëóêò, üáà …)
     • Spanish (¿¡ñ)
     • Swedish (äåö …)

The following quotation marks are available, which seems it would cover these languages: 

     'test' "test" “test” „test” ‛test’ ,test’¹ «test» ‹test› 《test》 「test」 — test

     ¹) Left side is a basic comma.

See the `_ACC` _accented characters_ layer for all characters with diacretic markings.
If you miss a symbol, you could replace one you don't use and add it yourself (by
reprogramming the source code).

8 Speed measuring
=================
      ‛Speed’ starts speed measuring.
      ‛SRprt’ stands for ‛Speed Report’:
                • Tap to get your speed report.
                • Hold for a while for led color compilation (see below).
      ☞ Text size counting (see below) middle led colors take precedence,
        when a maximum is set, over layer colors or speed measurement.

With the key ‛Speed’ on the `_RAR` layer, the speed of your latest
completed batch of 25 keypresses is computed, as well as the average of
all your batches of 25 keys. The speed is displayed as the color of the
middle led, which otherwise shows the layer color. A bright white middle
led indicates ‛Speed’ has just been activated.

With the key ‛SRprt’ (short for ‛Speed Report’), the keyboard
will write your typing speed either in keystrokes per second (k/s)
or words-per-minute (wpm), depending on your compilation configuration.

“Keystrokes per second” uses the following format: `<A k/s B.B k/s
Cx25keys>`. A is the amount of key presses per second (k/s) of your
last batch, B.B is your average over the last C batches of keys.
When using “Words per minute”, A is in word-per-minute, B is also
in words-per-minute: `<A wpm B wpm Cx25keys>`, no decimal precision.
Example: <150wpm;108wpm20x25keys>

Batches with 0 k/s are not counted to the average. You can take a
longer break without it affecting your average.

8.1 Speed Led color compilation assist
--------------------------------------
If you hold the ‛Speed Report’ key for one second, it will increment the
speed, and led color accordingly. This can be helpful when configuring
your speed measuring compile settings. This works best with speed
measuring set off.

9 Text size measuring
=====================
      ‛Cnt/Mx’ stands for ‛Count/Maximum’: 
                • Tap to start counting, tap again to suspend.
                • Hold > 0.5 seconds for maximum menu.
      ‛Cnull’ stands for ‛Count null’:
                • Tap to set the counts to zero.
      ‛CWmin’ stands for ‛Count Word minus’:
                • Tap to detract one word from the word count. 
                • Hold > 0.5 seconds to detract 10 words.
      ‛CRprt’ stands for ‛Count Report’:
                • Tap to get a counting report. 
      ☞ ‛Count’ and ‛Speed’ (see above) reports get added to the
        character count, but not to the word count.
      ☞ Auto-repeating keys do not get counted as characters.

You can count your text by character and word, by activating the key
‛Count’ on the `_RAR` layer. Pressing ‛Count’ again will suspend
counting, pressing it yet again resumes where the count left off earlier.
The middle led turns cyan when no maximum is set (see below),
or to green when it is set.

You can set a maximum to type, with the ‛Cnt/Mx’ key.  In your
editor (or wherever typing these characters is harmless) you will get
the following menu by pressing the ‛Cnt/MX’ key for at least half
a second: `<Nc|w>`. In here: *N* stands for your numerical input, *c*
for a maximum count in *characters* or *w* for a maximum in *words.*

Start typing a number, finish with either *c* or *w* to make the maximum
be counted in either characters or words. If you want to leave the
menu before giving *c* or *w*, enter a *dot* ‛.’ or ‛Escape’,
which will leave the maximum value at 0 (zero). A maximum value of zero
implies there is no maximum.

Setting a maximum of 1000 characters looks like so:

        Hold ‛Cnt/MX’ results in: `<Nc|w>` 
        Then type “1000” results in: `<Nc|w>1000`
        Then type “c” results in: `<Nc|w>1000->1000c`
        At this point the keyboard is out of this special input menu.

        The keyboard indicates what it accepted as your input, by 
        repeating the number, just before your last input is being printed.

With a maximum established, the middle led color goes from green to red,
as you type. When the maximum is reached, the keyboard will output a
Backspace character for every key you subsequently press, making it
impossible to go any further, until text size counting has been disabled,
or the count is reduced. The middle led changes color between red and 
white while at the maximum set size, for every new input character.

To get your word count report, press ‛CReport’ short for: ‛Count
Report’.  It comes in the form: `<Ac;Bw>`, where A is your character
count, and B is your word count. Example: `<5420c;547w>`. 

When a maximum is established, the report will only be given in
either characters or words, and the maximum is given with it, like so:
`<66w>[200w]`. 66 words have been written, a maximum of 200 words has
been set.

If you have a maximum established and use it across different articles,
you no longer have the total count. You can activate speed measuring,
which in its report includes the total characters pressed.

9.1 Text size Usage
-------------------
It is assumed that you will take the report in the document you are
editing, and then delete it. If you do character counting, the value of 
the report itself is added to the character count. Therefore you should
delete that without using an auto-repeating on the deletion key. That
way the characters are subtracted again.

If you count in words, the report is not added to the word count. You
can delete it however you want.

This works the same for a ‛*Speed* Report’ you might like to take.
You can take it in the document, and then delete it in the same,
without affecting the text size counting in characters or words.
When deleting keys with Backspace or Delete, the character count goes down
accordingly, the word count does not.

Words are counted by counting Space and Enter key presses. Immediately
repeating blanks do not add to the word count.  You can only manually
subtract from the word count, using the key ‛CWmin’ short for ‛Count
Word minus’. This means that if you delete sections in your document,
you need to manually subtract the same words.

Example: after typing something and then typing `<Enter>` twice to start a
new paragraph, counts for one word. When deleting three words with their
three blank areas, then tapping ‛Count Word minus’ three times,
should result in an accurate word count. To add words to the count,
type mock ones and then delete them: “x x x x” adds *three* words,
“y y  y ” also adds three words (three separate blank spaces).

Layer changes, shift and unusual/complex keys do not get counted.
Navigation, arrow and mouse keys do not get counted. Auto-repeating
of keys does not affect the *character* count, therefore should be avoided
if you want to count in characters.

10 Making your own base layer(s)
================================
You can insert your own `_DEF_BASE`, `_DEF_NSY` and/or `_ALT_BASE`, `_ALT_NSY`
Base plus number/symbols layer pairs, integrate it nicely with the rest 
of the code, and re-define a special characters layer to go with it if
you want (etc). The idea is to make it easy to change the alphanumerical
keys, while leaving the modifiers, layer switch keys etc. the same. 
`YOUR_KEYMAP` stands for a name you choose.

First we will look at a simple keymap, without its own configuration
options or header file.

     ① Make a file named: `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c`), with at least 
       those two layers: _..._BASE and _..._NSY. It is probably best to
       copy one of the existing `./base_....c` files, and edit that.

     ② Add a #define to `./user_config.h`:
       #define BASE_YOUR_KEYMAP__DEF_BASE
       #define BASE_YOUR_KEYMAP__ALT_BASE
       Under the topic ‛Base layers’ there is a comment to help you.

     ③ Edit ./keymap.c to have your new file #included, using your just defined
       preprocessor element. Close to the other #includes is a comment there to
       help you. Look just under the line with this, in ./keymap.c:

       const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
       (…)
       // // ⬇ insert your ./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c #include here:

       // # if defined(BASE_YOUR_KEYMAP__DEF_BASE) || defined(BASE_YOUR_KEYMAP__ALT_BASE)
       // #     include "./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c" // Your Keymap.
       // # endif

Now you have integrated your base layers alternative. To compile it:

     ④ _Activate_ your #define BASES_YOUR_KEYMAP__DEF_BASE or 
       BASES_YOUR_KEYMAP__ALT_BASE in `./user_config.h`,
       _Remove_ any other base layers from being defined on the
       same spot _DEF_BASE or _ALT_BASE to prevent a conflict.

     ⑤ Check Pre-processing with:
       > gcc -E keymap.c | less

     ⑥ Compile and flash to your keyboard.

You can redefine any layer in your new `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c`
You can do that by setting one or more of the `BASESFILE_LAYER_...` defines in 
your own `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c` file. See near the top of an existing 
`./base_....c` file for clues.
`_ACC` in particular is a layer meant to augment a keymap with special 
characters for a given language/layout in the base layer(s). Perhaps you
want to redefine it, for example.

Example: Having done the above points ① ➡ ④ for a `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c` file. 
Let's say you re-arranged keys on `_ACC` to suit ... French.

     ⑦ In your `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c`:
       #define `BASESFILE_LAYER_ACC`
       The `_ACC` in ./keymap.c will now be ignored.

You can re-define `_ACC` in your own file. 

     ⑧ Copy an existing `_ACC` layer into `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c` 
       Edit it so that French characters like ‛Ç’ ‛«»’, ‛œ’, ‛æ’,
       ‛ô’, ‛é’ etc. are in positions that work best. You can look in
       `unicode_weurope.h` to find some Unicode points already defined.

     ⑨ Compile and flash to your keyboard.

Now we will look at a more complicated keymap, where you are also altering
preprocessor constants defined in `./user_config.h`. (Warning, perhaps this
is overkill … ;-)

Example: the `./base_numpad.c` has an option to entirely eviscerate the
`_PAD` layer, for convenience. (Why is this even useful ? Good question !
One reason could be that it can set up a default, so that anyone who chooses
this `./base_numpad.c` Base layer, automatically is eviscerating the `_PAD`
_common_ layer, without having to do anything else. On the downside, it
could be confusing that one option is configured in two places.)

Having done the above points ⑦ ➡ ⑧ as well, let's say for some reason you
need to reverse Left GUI and Right GUI.

      ⑨ Copy your User Configuration Block at the top of your `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.c`
        and the GPL License, and place that in a new _header_ file: 
        `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.h` 
    
      ① ⓪  Write the necessary code to set and unset the constant
           `SWITCH_GUIS` in your `./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.h` file You are encouraged
           to write code which overrides any setting in `./user_config.h, for
           those constants which you choose to affect, for simplicity sake. 
           (This is not a C programming manual, so it won't get into this.)
   
      ① ①  Look in `./user_config.h`, and #include your header file there, in
           a similar way as was done for your C code file. It should be just
           below the user configuration block, and has a template for you.
   
      ① ②  Compile, flash and test.
   
      ① ③  It would be nice to put a remark on the general preprocessor constants
           which you might be affecting, that your keymap could be affecting them.
           You would edit the ./user_config.h comments with a short one line notice,
           such as:
   
           *
           * ⚠ Note: ./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.h can overrides this setting, if compiled with that ‛Base’ layer.
           */

Putting your `*.h` header file in `./user_config.h` isn't strictly
necessary, unless you alter “general preprocessor constants”
defined in `./user_config` (not local constants for your keymap only).

Perhaps a separate header file is overkill. On the other hand, whatever
preprocessor logic is necessary after user configuration has been given,
can be handled in one place, if #included as suggested. It allows you
to override the settings in `./user_config.h` from your header file
(because it is #included immediately below those). If a user is playing with
keymaps Base compile choices, it could be convenient to play with
`./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.h` settings, have everything that could be relevant
close at hand, then forgetting about those settings once compiling
with another Base layer, and be able to return to it with previous
configuration already done.

You can also just #include your header file at the top of your 
`./base_YOUR_KEYMAP.h` file, if it does not touch anything else but your
local keymap.

11 Eviscerations
================
Cutting down the keymap reduces the firmware size, and helps reducing
mental clutter from having masses of symbols you might never want to use.

You can compile as a single layout. Define only a ‛Default’ base pair,
and set `MINIFAN_SINGLE_LAYOUT` (`./user_config.h`). The leds for the
base layers letters and numbers&symbols, will show up as they would for
the ‛Alternate’ layer in a dual layout compilation.

You can remove the layers `_ACC`, `_DRA` and/or `_BON` (see
`./user_config.h` around `REMOVE_ACC`). 

You can remove a set of symbols from one or more of Unicode layers,
such as not having box drawing characters on `_BON`, or no sub-script
numbers on `_DRA`.

12 Key associations
===================
The keymap was designed to have the same or similar keys on the same key
or close to it, on different layers. Sometimes the association goes by
what finger is used, and/or on what row. For example the symbol ‛(’
on the numbers-symbols layer (`_NSY`), becomes the symbol ‛⁽’ on
another layer.

![Minivan layout Image associations](http://socialism.nl/misc/minivan/minivan-relationships_common_1500_vd.jpg)

13 Trouble shooting
===================
  • Compiling

  If the firmware is too large, you can try using a different version
  of the compiler, or you may have to reduce size by removing certain
  options.

  • Unicode

  Unicode is chaos: try going to `_RAR` layer, and hit the Unicode
  operating system buttons.

  • Leds

  Leds not working after flashing firmware: try going to `_RAR` layer, 
  and hit the key MLeds and SLeds, which switch Leds on/off.

  • Weird layer jumping

  You weirdly end up on the `_PAD`, `_FUN` or some other layer while
  typing ? If you jump to layers which are on Shift key toggles, this
  is a typing mistake. 

  • Difficult/impossible key combinations ?

  An example of a difficult key combination is: the modifier Control, 
  Shift, or Alt, with media key “volume up” (or down, etc). It may 
  work to press and hold “Control” (which should communicate “Control
  depressed”), then activate `_RAR` layer with the hold key (which 
  communicates nothing to the computer attached to the keyboard), 
  press and let go “volume up” (which should communicate just that), let
  go of the `_RAR` layer (which again communicates nothing), let go of
  the Control key (which should communicate “Control released”).. 

14 Why you want this layout
===========================
☞  This layout seems easy to learn and predictable.

☞  The normally most used layer after letters is “numbers & symbols” 
  (123…, !@#…, []/…, called `_NSY`). This layer you can access by either
  your left or right thumb, to spread fatigue.

☞  Right hand pinky is no longer overused, as it is on regular keyboards.

☞  0-9 enumerations / numbers, they are on the same fingers as a standard
  keyboard. 

☞  The symbols normally reached by shifting a number, are also still on
  the same fingers.

☞  Because one often uses an F-key only once, the layer can switch back
  to Base after an F-key is used.

☞  Modifier combination keys on `_FUN` layer for use with F-keys.

☞  The movement layer has a bunch of layout options, and allows for mouse
  use.

☞  The layer with Power buttons protects you from accidental keystrokes
  on the critical keys. 

☞  If you need working with Control/Shift/Alt and a pointing device in
  right hand, you can quickly get uncluttered such keys by tapping left shift.

☞  The accented layer makes it possible to set the keyboard in a mode
  on the computer side without dead-keys.

☞  The second Unicode layer adds a fair amount of fun stuff to spice up 
  your writing. Write H₂O, 2⁷·⁰=128, ±8 °C, §2.1, 2 ³/₈", a note⁴, £ 6.²⁵
  etc.
        
☞  The third Unicode layer adds a proper dash — and French style
  quotations «»‹› and other stuff. ①  «Ça va bien», ②  5 × 3 ≠ 14,
  ③  .083% ÷ 2 ≈ 4‱ ➡  4.₁₅‱

                  ┏━━━━━━┓
                  ┃ test ┃
                ┅━╋━━━━━━┛
                  ┇ ④

☞  Speed and text size measuring, including to set a maximum on your text input.
  These are features not part off regular keyboards.

☞  Easy to create your own dual layout for letters / numbers.

☞  If you do want to reprogram the code, it has a lot of comments to make
  it easier to follow.


15 BUGS
=======
  No real bugs known currently. Just some minor issues …

  The tilde ~ on the numbers-symbols layer should logically be reached on the second
  row without the need for _shift,_ however there seems to be a QMK limitation
  with this. No work around has been attempted as of yet. (It seems to be a minor issue;
  using shift for once seems OK.)

  `LCTL_T` `( KC_TAB )` is not seen as a blank by word counting, use as Control is not
  ignored in character counting. (This minor issue is ignored for now. Tab is not
  normally used in text writing.)

  The eviscerations may not have been worked out yet into the ultimate scrubbing of
  everything that may have become redundent, because it does complicate the code with
  a lot of #defines. Perhaps it should be done eventually, if there is an actual need.

  QMK support for their help, especially Drashna.

  _Personal note:_ This keymap came about because of a sudden need
  for a replacement keyboard. It took over a year to make (≈ 1.5 h/day).
  The goal became to make a good keymap for everyone without the time to
  make one, in the best keyboard format: “40%”.

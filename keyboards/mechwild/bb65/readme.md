BB65 is a completely normal BlackPill-powered 65% DIY kit. Itâ€™s got all the letters, a number row, and arrow keys. Basic as it can be.

The `f401` version is the standard for this kit, using an STM32F401 BlackPill. The `f411` version will not run on an STM32F401 BlackPill; if in doubt, use `f401`.

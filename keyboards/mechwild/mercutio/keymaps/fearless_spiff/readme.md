Fearless Spiff's Custom Mercutio Keymap
  - "Programmer"-centric and German layout based keymap
  - Based on Bongocat and Jonavin keymap

Features
  - Fancy Bongocat! Yay! (borrowed from bongocat obviously)
  - Encoder selectable key codes and displayed on OLED (borrowed and multi-line-enhanced from Jonavin)
    - Change encoder_keys in keymap.c to assign your desired key selection
  - Additional encoder functionality 
    - While holding FN_1, page up and down
    - While holding FN_2, volume up and down
  - Use my templates for your own layout overview at [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com) using my gist [here](https://gist.github.com/FearlessSpiff)

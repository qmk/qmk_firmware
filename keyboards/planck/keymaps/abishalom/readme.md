# Abishalom Planck Layout

Mostly the same as default. Changes:
- Get rid of COLEMAK and DVORAK layers
- Add new layer (NAV) which is accessed by holding the ESC key. This brings up arrow keys in ijkl spots, along with handy media funcions in wasd.
- Move left control to the corner, put caps lock between LCTRL and LGUI
- Adjustments to media keys in bottom right corner

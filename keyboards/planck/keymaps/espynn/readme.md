Added several custom functions to the keymap from the "ab" map. Special thanks to "mollat" for demonstration of macros in their keymap.c

* Online keyboard layout editor: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/
* [JSON of raw layout] (layout.json "JSON of raw layout")

# Notes
* Simultaneous RAISE+LOWER enters CUSTOM layer. Several custom keymaps are here
* I disregarded the advice of Jack and used macros for passwords. I accept my fate. These have been abstracted to macros 2, 3, and 4
* add your mobile and email to the keymap before make
* RAISE and LOWER also acts as PgUp and PgDn when tapped.
* Bracket/ paran/ brace keys are placed in the center of the keyboard for programmer's convenience.

## changes
* Removed some unneeded keys from raise and lower layers
* moved the + and = signs, backspace is now more intuitive
* moved all the Function keys to CUSTOM layer
* added ctrl alt del to CUSTOM layer
* simplified the layout picture greatly

# jdelkins layout

Features:

- 2x2u layout with the split spaces both operating as layer keys
- No top row numbers; rely on a keypad layer
- My typical leader setup for toggling modes, accessing secrets, etc.


# TODO

- Add/improve audio features
- Fix \_ADJUST layer - there's a bunch of junk on there that needs cleanng up.

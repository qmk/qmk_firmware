# VIA QWERTY layout for Planck Rev6
A heavily simplified version of the Planck Layout that deals with VIA layer limit by stripping out Dvorak, Colemak, and Plover layouts as well as all internal audio, lighting, and mod switching keys.

Predefined Layers:
- 0 - Default Planck QWERTY keymap (minus lighting control, plus SHIFT ENTER)
- 1 - Default Planck LOWER keymap
- 2 - Default Planck RAISE keymap
- 3 - UTILITY keymap (QK_BOOT, DEBUG)

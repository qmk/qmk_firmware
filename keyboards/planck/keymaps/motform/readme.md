# Motform Planck Layout

This layout is based off the [colemak-se](github.com/motform/colemak-se)
layout and features many tweaks to make working with Emacs and
evil-mode more ergonomi. As with the colemak layout itself, the idea
is to concentrate as much movement as possible to the home row.

To properly use the layout in Emacs, set Super to LGUI and Meta to RGUI.
Unless you are running a permutation of the MacOS Swedish QWERTY-layout,
modifiers will probably not work. For future develoment, I’m planning
to add support for MS Windows SE-QWERTY in the form of a secondary layer.

## Quantum MK Firmware
For the full Quantum feature list, see [the parent readme.md](/readme.md).


## Additional Notes
The Org60 seems to be a variant of the XD60 (which is essentially a GH60 rev. C, with support for a right-hand arrow cluster), which has USB-C and built-in RGB underlighting.

Compatibility with GH60 expansion boards is unknown.

Board also supports in-switch LEDs (two-pin, single colour), as well as WS2182 LED strips for underglow lighting.

Default keymap included, matching configuration on sale page.


## Build
To build the default keymap, simply run `make org60:default`.

# Gipsy-King's Cornelius layout

Common typing only needs a base and a symbols layer. Layer changes are on the
thumbs *including* shift and non-english variants.

The importance of having shift on your thumbs is that you don't need to press
some letters with pinky OR ring, depending on shift.

## Base QWERTY layer

* Tab, Backspace, Space, Ctrl/Alt/Mod are similar to a generic keyboard.
* Esc is like when you remap CapsLock to Esc on a generic keyboard (vim).
* Enter is on right thumb and raises Symbol layer on hold, because you rarely
  hold.
* Shifts are on both thumbs!
* Leftmost thumb changes to Xmonad window management layer.
* Rightmost thumb is Right-Alt which is for `us-intl-altgr` layout (althoug I
  use kmonad to universally map international characters on all keyboards).
* `-` and `=` are on the lower pinkies.
* `F20` is mic-mute on my thinkpad laptop.

## Symbol layer (Raise)

* Top row is numbers, bottom row are their symbols. Most people do it the other
  way 'round.
* Middle row has curly brackets, and some navigation and arrows.
* Square brackets are on the lower pinkies.
* ```~\|`` are places aroung top/outer corners.

## Xmonad layer (Window management)

I use Xmonad to completely manage windows with just my keyboard. This layer
accommodates most shortcuts.

## Fn layer

Lastly, some macros, mousekeys (not used, really), some media keys, and the
function-keys (I use them maybe once in a decade).

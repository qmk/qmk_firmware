# The HYBRID keymap for MiniTKL

![keymap](https://images2.imgbox.com/00/22/vjrqgfHy_o.png)

This keymap is designed to be able to have an ISO keyboard with the ANSI Return
key. This is useful in, at least, two cases:

* some programmers prefer the ANSI key, but want to use European languages.
* some keycaps come without ISO return key, even for European languages layouts.

The `Fn` key trigger `KC_APP` when tapped, and activate Layer 1 when held.

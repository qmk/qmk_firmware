# tobiasvl's ISO layout for HHKB

This is my attempt to adapt my regular 60% Norwegian ISO layout to the physical HHKB layout, on the Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2 keyboard with the alternate QMK-compatible Hasu controller.

## Base layer

The following changes have been made from standard HHKB:

* The ] and \ keys are swapped so they're in the ISO locations, but a row higher. Whether or not this is a good idea depends heavily on what specific language layout you're using, but it makes sense for Norwegian, I think.
* The Fn key is replaced with the ISO key (ie. "non-US backslash"). It's gotta go somewhere!
* The spacebar doubles as space when tapped and Fn when held (ie. SpaceFN). This is a personal preference, but my second and more traditional choice would probably be to replace right GUI/Super with Fn.
* Grave Escape has been added (shift + Esc produces ~).

## Function layer

This is just how I personally prefer to set up my function layer, and doesn't have anything to do with ISO. You probably want to swap out this wholesale for your own function layer.

* Navigation is moved: Arrow keys on WASD, Page Up and Page Down on QE, Home and End on the right (I have them to the left of the vertical Enter on ISO layouts).
* Grave Escape has been added (Fn + Esc produces \`).
* No media keys or anything. I don't use them.

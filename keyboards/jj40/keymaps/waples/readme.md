# Waples jj40 keymap
> based heavily on my lets split
[Waples](https://www.github.com/Waples)

### Layers
I currently have the following layers in my keymap:
* Qwerty 	(as default)
* Dvorak	(still learning this type of layout, so not really used much)
* Lefty		(lower)
* Righty	(raise)
* Dual		(adjust)

### Note to self:
YOU NEED TO USE [bootloadHID -r jj40_waples.hex](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/jj40)

## the stuff below is out of date and I think about removing them from this readme

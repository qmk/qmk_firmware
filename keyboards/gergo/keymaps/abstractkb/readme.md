This is my personal modification to the stock gergo keymap.

## Settings
To edit various settings, enable the 1u trackball and whatnot please modify /keyboards/gergo/keymaps/default/rules.mk

Ideally you should copy this directory and make your changes there. If you come up with a good layout submit a PR!

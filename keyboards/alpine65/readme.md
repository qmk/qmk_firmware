# Alpine65 QMK Firmware

## Introduction

This is the QMK firmware repository for the Alpine65, a 65% hotswap keyboard designed by Bitmap Designs and Gondolindrim.

The Alpine65 has entered GB and sucessfully finalized in november 2020; there is no further way to buy an Alpine65 other than the secondhand market. The IC page for the keyboard can be found [here](https://https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=106974).

## How to compile

After setting up your build environment, you can compile the Alpine65 default keymap by using:

    make alpine65:default

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).

The QuarkÂ² PCB is a hotswap version of the Quark PCB. Just like the OG, it has a modified layout than a traditonal 4x12 and 5x12 ortholinear keyboard. 

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Nasp](https://github.com/npspears)
* Hardware Supported: Planck
* Hardware Availability: https://www.checkerboards.xyz/Quark2_p_35.html

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make checkerboards:quark_squared:default
    
These boards may be reset into bootloader either via the reset hardware button (on the back of the PCB near the USB connector) or through a configured RESET shortcut inserted into the keymap.

The Phoenix45_Ortho PCB is an ortholinear alternative to Mechvault's Phoenix45. It should also work in the JD45. 

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Nasp](https://github.com/npspears)
* Hardware Supported: Phoenix45
* Hardware Availability: https://www.checkerboards.xyz/phoenix45-ortho.html

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make checkerboards/phoenix45_ortho:default

To put the PCB into bootloader mode, short the two pin holes together that are just beneath diode #23.

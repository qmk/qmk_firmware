# The default keymap for Duet

Since this is a very irregular keyboard with unique use cases, the keymap should be customized to meet one's needs and to match the requirements of the corresponding display software (if any).  
By default, all keys send `KC_0` to simply notify the host that an arbitrary key has been pressed.

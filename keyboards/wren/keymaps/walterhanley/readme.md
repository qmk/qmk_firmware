# Author's Wren Layout

This is my personal Wren layout, which includes a few layers and macros that 
I find useful. It started as a clone of the default keymap, but will likely
diverge more as time goes on.

Please note that this layout preserves the entire keyboard matrix, but only 
includes keycodes for a numpad/nav cluster configuration. Depending on your 
configuration, you may need to replace some of the existing KC_NO values 
with actual keycodes.

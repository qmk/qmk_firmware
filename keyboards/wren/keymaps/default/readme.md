# Default Wren Layout

This is the default Wren layout, which lacks any layers. It should be fairly 
straightforward, with the sole exception of the equals key in the place of the 
grave key and the grave key in the place of the delete key. 

This layout preserves the entire keyboard matrix, but only includes keycodes 
for a numpad/nav cluster configuration. Depending on your configuration, you 
may need to replace some of the existing KC_NO values with actual keycodes.

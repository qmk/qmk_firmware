The Boardwalk is a 60% ortholinear keyboard, designed around Ergodox keycap sets and to fit into many standard 60% cases. The project was inspired by OLKBâ€™s Atomic keyboard, which used larger 2u mods, but u/shensmobile
decided to switch to 1.5u keys so that Ergodox sets would provide excellent compatibility. The rest of the board can be covered using standard key sizes from 60% sets.

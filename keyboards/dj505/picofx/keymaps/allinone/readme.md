# PicoFX All-in-one Keymap

The 'allinone' keymap puts most of the buttons that you need for navigating the Pump It Up Rise menus in the main mode. If you configure the game to use those buttons for gameplay as well, then you can play the game and navigate most of the menus without having to switch modes.

```
  Q           E        Tab         Up
        X                     G
  A           D       Space       Down

 Service: Esc when tapped, or temporarily activates the mode below when held
 Test: Enter
```

When Service is held the buttons have these meanings instead:
```
  F1         F2         F5         F6
        -                     -
  F3         F4         F7         F8

 Test: Bootloader mode
```

# PicoFX Menu Mode Keymap

The 'menumode' keymap is like the 'default' keymap in that it matches the 'Basic 2' preset in Pump It Up Rise, but it also includes the ability the toggle into a menu mode that provides most of the keys you need to navigate the game's menus.

In the game's options menu, navigate to the keyboard settings and press '2' (on your normal computer keyboard) to apply the 'Basic 2' preset.

The keymap in normal mode:
```
  Q           E         R           Y
        S                     G
  Z           C         V           N

 Test: Toggle to menu mode
```

And when in menu mode:
```
  Q           E        Tab          Up
       Esc                  Enter
 Left       Right     Space        Down

 Service: F1
 Test: Toggle back to game mode
```

It might take a little bit of practice to remember where everything is in menu mode. The rule of thumb is that the layout roughly corresponds to where those controls appear on the game's song selection screen.

In either mode, holding the Service button and pressing the Test button will put the controller into bootloader mode for installing new firmware versions.

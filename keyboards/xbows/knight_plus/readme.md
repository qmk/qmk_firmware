Knight_Plus is an Ergonomic Mechanical keyboard suite redesigned by X-Bow that includes both the main keyboard and the numpad.

If you spend your work days in front of a computer, you have likely felt some discomfort after a long day of typing. While spending less time on our computers would be the ideal remedy for this problem, that is not a realistic solution for most people. X-Bows was designed to limit the stress on your hands and wrists while also providing a productive and stylish typing experience.


X-Bows was designed with three criteria in mind:
* Enhancing the comfort and ergonomics of the keyboard
* Limiting the learning curve for our new layout
* Creating an attractive design

Nature, A 86 Keys Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard with RGB backlight.

If you spend your work days in front of a computer, you have likely felt some discomfort after a long day of typing. While spending less time on our computers would be the ideal remedy for this problem, that is not a realistic solution for most people. X-Bows was designed to limit the stress on your hands and wrists while also providing a productive and stylish typing experience.


X-Bows was designed with three criteria in mind:
* Enhancing the comfort and ergonomics of the keyboard
* Limiting the learning curve for our new layout
* Creating an attractive design


* Keyboard Maintainer: X-BOWS
* Hardware Supported: X-BOWS Nature
* Hardware Availability: [X-BOWS](https://x-bows.com/)

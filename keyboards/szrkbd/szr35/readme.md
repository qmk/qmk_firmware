Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make szrkbd/szr35:default

If you want you can use the keymap that came with the keyboard from factory:

    make szrkbd/szr35:factory

You need to flash each half of the keyboard with the same firmware:

    make szrkbd/szr35:default:flash

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Holding top left key for the left half, top right key for the right half, while plugging in the USB cable.
* **Physical reset button**: Short the reset pads, marked within a white rectangle, while plugging in. Not the ones at the edge opposing the USB connectors but about 2 or 3 centimeters from that edge.
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available.

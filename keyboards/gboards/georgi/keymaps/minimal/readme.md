# Georgi QWERTY/Steno firmware

This is the default keymap for Georgi, it's based heavily off of the naps62 ErgoDox and the Gergo layout. 
It is both a ergonomic and programmer friendly keymap.

Ideally you should copy this directory and make your changes there. If you come up with a good layout submit a PR!

## Space issues
If you find yourself running out of space for dictionary entries, disabling mousekeys in rules.mk will save
you about 4k for entries!
Get a free 1k by deleting the Gaming layers from the keymap!

# # Dennytom's Georgi Layout

This keymap is using a custom chording engine. Head out to my (DennyTom) user space to find the source files and details.

To make a real keymap from the JSON file, run 

```sh
python3 parser.py keymap_def.json keymap.c
```

Likely will change with use. I enjoy the modifiers on the "home row".

# # Dennytom's Butterstick Layout

This keymap is using a custom chording engine. Head out to my (DennyTom) user space to find the source files and details.

To make a real keymap from the JSON file, run 

```sh
python3 parser.py keymap_def.json keymap.c
```

Somehow it fits the whole keyboard on 20 keys. For longer typing sessions, use the ASET NIOP mode.

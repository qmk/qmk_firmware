![Key 65](https://i.imgur.com/28Qck8ul.jpg)

Key 65 is featured with the three-layer case and dual-gasket structure. The plate mounting system is an improved version of the gasket sandwich on Leaf 60. In addition, we add gaskets between the middle case and the bottom case. There's an optional rubber sheet between the PCB and the plate. The numerous options will offer you the most freedom to make the keyboard look and feel as you wish.

# Keyboardio Atreus with an SLF layout from PoweredByPorridge

SLF stands for [Stiff Little Fingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_Little_Fingers) who were a great punk band from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Stiff Little Fingers is also a good way of describing my hands, a condition which I ascribe to too many winters cycling without gloves. So, I need a keyboard and layout to cope.

I use a Keyboardio Atreus, in fact, they're so good, I use two. I tried all sorts of layouts, and finally came up with the one that suits my stiff fingers.

It has four layers:

0 - Normal - letters and punctuation.

1 - Symbols (shifted numbers), arrow keys, assorted function keys, Del and Backspace.

2 - Numbers, page up, page down, home, and end. Similar assorted functions.

3 - F1 to F14, play/pause, volume up/down, Left-shift-Alt left, right, up, down.

Autoshift is important, I use it all the time.

I use tap dance (one, two, or three key presses) for:

* Braces, brackets, and curly brackets. TD(L_BRAX) and TD(R_BRAX)
* Hash (pound), tilde, and backtick. TD(TACHE)
* Single quote, double quote, and @. TD(QUOTS)

There are odd keys that are there for a particular reason:
* F24 - my [I3](https://i3wm.org/) popup to remind me of stuff I always forget.
* Alt-shift-left/right/up/down - multi-select in Sublime text.

This is a qwerty layout for the keyboardio/atreus. For the most part, it's a
straightforward layout. Only the modifiers key are not organized like the default
layout. Those modifier keys are mostly symmetrically configured.

The idea is that when using a modifier key, some users may expect to use both side of
the keyboard symmetrically (as in emacs, qutebrowser, terminal/tmux).

Exceptions to the rules are the `Escape` and the `Super` which only exists on the left
Side of the keyboard. Those are mostly unused.

Note that some keys are not present in the keyboard (e.g `Tab`, `Enter`, ...) since they
are available from the legacy terminal bindings:

- Ctrl-i: Tab
- Ctrl-m: Enter
- Ctrl-h: Backspace
- Ctrl-d: Del
- Ctrl-n: Down
- Ctrl-p: Up

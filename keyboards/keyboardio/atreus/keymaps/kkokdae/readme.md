# kkokdae keymap - Keyboardio Atreus

This is the keymap available for keyboardio/atreus keyboards.

The default layout used [Colemak Mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/). The prefix keys for vim/tmux users. The symbol is designed for ease of use by programmers.

It used the idea of [Caps Work Behavior](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/caps-word) by ZMK Firmware. I want to officially add this feature to QMK in the future

# pugmajere's fairly modified version of the default keymap

This is fairly modified, but roughly follows the original default
keymap in spirit.

- The num lock layer is removed.
- The "any" key is replace with RALT.
- The thumb keys are converted into combo keys.
- Page-Up is a combo key with LCTRL.
- The NUMLOCK key is replaced with LCTRL-PGUP (for bouncing through
  browser tabs)
- Mouse scroll keys are added.
- Some KVM control sequences are worked into a few open slots in the
  keymap. (FN-[tgb])
- QMK-standard debouncing is enabled.
- A bunch of RGB Matrix modes are turned off to save space.

Quite possibly something else that I'm forgetting about.

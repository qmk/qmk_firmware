## Programming the Keyboard

To program the keyboard, if you have avrdude installed:

    make keyboardio/model01:default:flash

When prompted to reset your keyboard, press the prog key at upper left. If the
keyboard does not reset, you can hold the prog key while plugging it into your
computer. The prog key will light up red in programming mode.

## Features

This implements the standard keymap, including mousekeys.

It doesn't do cursor warping - QMK does not support absolute mouse positioning.

LED support is limited. Gamma compensation and the high speed batch update
functions supported by the hardware are not implemented. The high current power
switch is also not implemented, so if you try and turn all the LEDs on at full
brightness, something may conk out.

Hotplugging the two halves works but is not extensively tested.

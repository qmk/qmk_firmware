# emdarcher's TADA68 layout

A layout that adds a few extra features on the function layers. Designed for use in a MAC or Unix environment, and has some VIM inspiration.

- Added Caps Lock for an extra FN layer with VIM like control on hjlk keys.
- Added Breathing Backlight Toggle.
- Made the ESC key use GESC for functionality for Grave and Tilde with shift or GUI modifiers.
- Added Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause keys on P,[,] keys to add Mac screen brightness control.
    * On Mac, Scroll Lock is Brightness Down and Pause is Brightness Up, so with this FN+[ = brighness down, FN+] = brightness up
- Has Mac Fast-forward and Rewind keys mapped for changing media tracks. FN+; = Rewind, FN+' = Fast-forward
- Moved LGUI to the default MAC Command key position.
- Has a mouse control layer that is activated by pressing both FN and CAPS LOCK
- FN+X toggles the backlight breathing mode

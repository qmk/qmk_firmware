# onelivesleft TADA68 layout for ISO UK

This is a layout designed with programming in mind.  It's a modification of the `iso-uk` layout, and has been tested on a TADA68 purchased from kbdfans in May 2019. The physical key layout includes the "double height" iso Enter key and the "short" Left Shift along side the iso Backslash key.

# replicaJunction - Atreus Layout

I no longer actively use this keyboard. I've replaced it with the [Keyboardio Atreus](../../../keyboardio/atreus/keymaps/replicaJunction/readme.md).

I still try to make sure the layout compiles, but I'm no longer tweaking it or adding new features.

Most of the interesting features in this layout are defined in [my userspace folder](../../../../users/replicaJunction/readme.md). Refer to the documentation and code there for more details.

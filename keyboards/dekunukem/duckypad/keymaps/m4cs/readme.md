[M4cs'](https://github.com/M4cs) duckyPad Layout

### Layers:

0: Default Layer w/ Media Functionality and Macros

1: RGB Menu that allows RGB customization

2: Alternate Macro Menu

### Configuration:

To change the menu, edit the `MT_X_XX` values in `config.h`. The sytax is as follows: `MT_A_B`, where A equals the layer, and B equals the key from 0-14.

### Misc. Info:

The macros currently just map to Ctrl + Alt + (Different Keys) right now. I have them launching certain shortcuts. I recommend you change these and add your shortcuts to match your shortcut manager.

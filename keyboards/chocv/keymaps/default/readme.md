# chocV Keymap

The default keymap provided here is useful for testing and as a base
for your own mapping, but does not include layers and is missing many
keycodes. To build the default keymap for testing:

make chocv:default

## Give Miryoku a try

If you are looking for a full fetured keymap, you can build the 
firmware with Miryoku without any additional work

For details and building instructions and options please see the
[The official Miryoku QMK
Repo](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku)

The command to build with the default Miryoku layout is:

make chocv:manna-habour_miryoku

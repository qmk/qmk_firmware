# RMW Kyria Layout

This is a Kyria edition of the keymap I use on the Ergodox_EZ I use for work. I write reports and code in a variety of languages on that board and the various layers provide plenty of flexibility for navigating, editing text, and writing code and prose. This keymap is mostly Mac-focused in its shortcuts and tapdances.

## The theory of this keymap

The base layer is either QWERTY or MINIMAK4, as desired. Overlaid on that base layer are various layers triggered by one-shots, TOs, and LTs. Tapdances are used to cram lots of mods into few keys and provide freedom to hit combinations with either hand. Mods and layer things are one-shot (where reasonable) because I prefer that. 

An EDIT layer provides text navigation, selection, and editing capabilities in home position. The NUMPAD layer offers a numpad and various spreadsheet-useful navigations and operations. Holding S will put the numpad under your right hand in home position. Keys F and J offer various useful symbols (mostly) on the opposite hand when held, including \[\]\(\)\{\} under the left pointer and middle fingers on bottom, middle, and top rows respectively. The MEDIA layer provides media controls (obvs) and some mouse movement and nav, in case I don't feel like reaching for the trackball/trackpad/mouse.

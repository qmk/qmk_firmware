# Elora's Debug Keymap

To make debugging your build as easy as possible, we have provided a special debugging keymap. It is not intended to actually type on, it is just here to make sure that your hardware is working correctly.

## Keys

The left side uses lowercase letters, the right side uses uppercase ones.

## Encoders

Encoders output a number, depending on the installed position.
These correspond to the index used for custom encoder code.

The number is followed by either a `+` or a `-`, depending on the direction turned.

## LEDs

Underglow RGB should be fading between red and off.

## OLEDs

Both the primary and secondary side should be filled with characters.

# SuperLyra Keyboard
By Domanic Calleja - https://github.com/Malevolti

SuperLyra is a 90 key column-staggered ergonomic keyboard. Based on the Lyra split with the addition of a centre numpad for ambidextorous use. 
This version is a single pcb as opposed to a split, with the alphanumeric segments angled at 30 degrees to eachother.
There is an open source PCB available via https://github.com/Malevolti/SuperLyra

The SP Mini is a 40% version of the SP-111 created in a collaboration of OneCreativeMind and BlindAssassin111 (Viktus owner). All design done by BlindAssassin111. The layout includes an F Row, left macro column, and arrows. Rotary encoders are supported in the top left and right positions. 

The SP Mini has dual ATMEGA32U4 controllers linked with USB Type C. Each PCB half has a single reset button and a standard AVR ISP header for reflashing the MCU in case of a bootloader issue.

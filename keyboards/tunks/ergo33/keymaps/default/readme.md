# Default Ergo33 Layout

This is the default layout for the Ergo33. It mostly follows the left side of a normal keyboard, except since there is an extra column on the left, `0` is above `TAB` and the left column is:
```
ESC
Y
H
N
GUI (Win)
```
The encoder acts as a mouse scrollwheel and encoder press is `Enter`. On the top LEDs the 1st is a layer indicator and the 3rd is a caps lock indicator.

# IBM Model M Space Saving Keyboard (SSK, 84-key)

This is the parent directory for all projects that replace the controller
of IBM's Model M space saving keyboard keyboard with 84 keys and then run QMK on it.

These controllers differ in their use of microcontrollers, connection (mainly
USB) optional speakers etc.

Some of them can be bought fully assembled others are do-it-yourself.

## Warning - Model M Variants

**Not all of these projects will fit into your keyboard!**

As the Model M was produced over several years there are many variants of the
controller PCB. Check what fits your keyboard before you build/order one.

The variants built for PCs differ in:
* PCB size
* Connectors (8/12 pin flex, location)
* Ground wire connector location

Additionally IBM built Model M variants with 101/102 keys, the 
terminal keyboard with 122 keys etc.

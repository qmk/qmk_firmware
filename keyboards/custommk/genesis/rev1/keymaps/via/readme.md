# Genesis Macro Pad Layout for VIA

This is the via layout for the Genesis Macro Pad. It is identical to the default 1u layout which assumes all 1u switches and optional rotary encoder in the top-left or top-right corner for media volume control. The top-left switch activates Layer 1 which enables control of the RGB underglow.

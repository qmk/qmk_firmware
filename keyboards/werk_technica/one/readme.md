From looks to sound and feel, Werk One was designed as a cost is no object flagship product. A modular 75% exploded profile keyboard kit with hybrid gasket mount array and AEK-styled classic side profile curve.

In a world of minimalism, Werk One is our tribute to the sophistication of art deco and 70â€™s futurism.

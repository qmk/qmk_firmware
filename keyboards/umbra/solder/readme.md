## Bootloader

How to enter bootloader (DFU):
* PCB will arrive flashed. With USB plugged in press Fn+Esc to enter DFU. Flash the firmware and replug the USB cable to fresh boot the PCB.

* If that method fails please locate the RESET header on the back of the PCB just right of the MCU. Short the 2 plated holes for 2 seconds to enter DFU. Flash the firmware and replug the USB cable to fresh boot the PCB.

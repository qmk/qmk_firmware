# ErgoDox EZ Utilities

## compile_keymap.py

The Python script in this directory, by [mbarkhau](https://github.com/mbarkhau) allows you to write out a basic ErgoDox EZ keymap using Markdown notation, and then transpile it to C, which you can then compile. It's experimental, but if you're not comfortable using C, it's a nice option.

## keymap_beautifier.py

This Python 3 script, by [Tsan-Kuang Lee](https://github.com/tsankuanglee) takes the keymap.c downloaded from [ErgoDox EZ Configurator](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/) and beautifies it for easier customization, allowing one to quickly draft a layout to build upon.

See [README.md](./keymap_beautifier/README.md) for this utility for more details.

# VIA Keymap for the Moonlander

This is based on the default layout for the Moonlander keyboard from ZSA Techonology Labs. 

ZSA does not provide any support for VIA (the app or firmware feature).  Any and all issues should be directed to [VIA](https://github.com/the-via). 

Initial flash and reflash may make the keyboard look like it has locked up.  This is because it can take a while to load the EEPROM data (the keymap), and is halted by that process until it's finished.

# emdarcher's MF68 Layout

A layout mostly based off the factory layout, but with some modifications. Designed for use in a MAC or Unix environment, and has some VIM inspiration.

- Utilizes the Pro Micro's on board LED's to show the CAPS LOCK status.
- Added Caps Lock for an extra FN layer with VIM like control on hjlk keys.
- Made the ESC key use GESC for functionality for Grave and Tilde with shift or GUI modifiers.
- Added Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause keys on P,[,] keys to add Mac screen brightness control.
    * On Mac, Scroll Lock is Brightness Down and Pause is Brightness Up, so with this FN+[ = brighness down, FN+] = brightness up
- Has Mac Fast-forward and Rewind keys mapped for changing media tracks. FN+; = Rewind, FN+' = Fast-forward
- Moved LGUI to the default MAC Command key position.

Note: By default, this keymap doesn't utilize the backlighting.

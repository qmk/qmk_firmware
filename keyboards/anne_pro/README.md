QMK firmware port for the Anne Pro 60% keyboard produced by [Obins](http://en.obins.net).

__This firmware is not created or supported by the creator of this keyboard!__

Keyboard Maintainer: [Michiel Visser](https://github.com/msvisser)  
Hardware Supported: Anne Pro (this means no support for the _Anne Pro 2_)  
Hardware Availability: Discontinued, [possible vendors](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/wiki/vendors)

Make sure you check out the correct branch for this keyboard!

    git checkout anne_pro

Before building the firmware for this keyboard submodules have to be loaded and a patch has to be applied:

    make git-submodule
    ./keyboards/anne_pro/apply_patch.sh

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make anne_pro:default

Flashing the firmware can easily be done when the keyboard is in DFU mode:

    make anne_pro:default:dfu-util

The default Arrows and macOS keyboard layouts are also included and can be used with `arrow` or `macos` instead of `default`.

To convert the `bin` file to a `dfu` file the following script can be used

    ./keyboards/anne_pro/dfuse-pack.py -b 0x08004000:anne_pro_default.bin anne_pro_default.dfu

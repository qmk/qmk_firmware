# Anne Pro macOS keymap

### Maintainer: [msvisser](https://github.com/msvisser)

This keymap is the macOS keymap supplied on the original Anne Pro firmware.
However the interface for Bluetooth is changed slightly.

### Bluetooth
To enable the Bluetooht layer press `FN+B`.

While in the Bluetooth layer:
- `ESC` - Exit Bluetooth layer
- `1, 2, 3, 4` - Connect to saved profile
- `Q, W, E, R` - Save connection to profile
- `A, S, D, F` - Delete saved connection
- `0` - Toggle legacy Bluetooth mode
- `-` - Disable Bluetooth
- `+` - Enable Bluetooth

Finally the lighting on the `ESC` key tries to indicate the connection status
of the Bluetooth. However this might sometimes go out of sync. To update the
connection status press the left `CTRL` key.

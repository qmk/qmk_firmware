Inspired by Dbroqua's layout

[Layer 1](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0e7798cb81c8f76baa5066ec1c34df8e): pretty standard layout. Shift + esc = ~, unlike normal hhkb.
[Layer 2](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/096099221ac48d4d0c84a2b859bbb7c0): Vim-like layout.
[Layer Vim](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/73b27b51c5e18d7999cc5fa39b4f3389) : vim layout until exit layout

## Programming Instructions:

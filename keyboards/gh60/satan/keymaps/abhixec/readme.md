Currently there are 3 layers:

1. Base Layer is qwerty
2. 1st layer is colemak
3. 2nd layer is function layer 
4. 3rd layer is extend layer

How to use the layers:
1. Base is default. If you want Colemak then press function key and del next to the right shift (this combination will be used to toggle the layer on and off)
2. Function layer is accessible by holding down the function key.
3. Extend layer is accsessible by holding down the capslock.
   Which when tapped acts like backspace when held triggers the Extend layer capability.

# ISO layout for the Satan GH60

I've wanted to make this as close to a P0ker as possible, but some macros in
the P0ker don't make sense...

Some of the features:
* Caps activates special features when held:
  * Arrow keys directly under right hand
  * Volume control
  * Fn keys on number row
  * PageUp/PageDn/Home/other general buttons
* Mouse control
* Numpad (works so much better if this would be ortho)
### RGB-strip

1894 is a keyboard PCB supporting 60% layouts. It is a revised version of the [Voyager60](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Voyager60) pcb by [ai03](https://github.com/ai03-2725) that supports a JST connector instead of usb-c and has perimeter cutouts for gasket support. The Voyager60 and therefore the 1894 is compatible with ai03's [polaris](https://github.com/austexcn/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ai03/polaris) QMK implementation and as such this is just a copy with edits to update the name.

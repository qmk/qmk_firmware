# bcat's Lily58 layout

This split ergo layout follows my preferred [Crkbd
layout](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/bcat)
with the following changes:

* There's an optional number row at the top of the keyboard. I am quite used to
using layers for numbers and symbols, so in practice this goes unused.

* The dedicated Hyphen/Underscore and Equals/Plus keys on the number row are
placed in the same positions as on the ErgoDox EZ. (There's no real reason for
this; I just had to do _something_ with those keys.)

* The extra thumb keys are used for dedicated Super/Menu keys, as well as
browser back/forward navigation keys.

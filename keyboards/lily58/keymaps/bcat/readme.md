# bcat's Lily58 layout

This split ergo layout follows my preferred [split 3x6 + 3 thumb
keys](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/layouts/community/split_3x6_3/bcat)
(Crkbd) layout with a few changes:

* There's an optional number row at the top of the keyboard. I am quite used to
using layers for numbers and symbols, so in practice this goes unused.

* The dedicated Hyphen/Underscore and Equals/Plus keys on the number row are
placed in the same positions as on the ErgoDox EZ. (There's no real reason for
this; I just had to do _something_ with those keys.)

* The extra thumb keys on the bottom row are used for a Left Alt key (for easier
Alt+Tab, Alt+F4, etc.) and a dedicated Super key.

* The harder-to-reach thumb keys below the controllers are bound to browser
back/forward navigation keys.

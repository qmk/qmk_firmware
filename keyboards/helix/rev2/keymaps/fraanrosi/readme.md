## Fraanrosi
A **Latin American Spanish** keymap for Helix/rev2/under, 5 rows.   
Designed to be as simple and more touch typing oriented as possible.    
It was inspired by a DELL Latitude E5470.

## Layers

The Helix obviously does not have enough keys compared to a typical keyboard.  
The keymap has multiple layers, moving extra keys to different layers.

|Priority|Layer ID|Layer Name|Contents|
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- |
||0|Qwerty|Qwerty layout (Base)|
||1|Lower|Symbols, media, function keys and mouse.(Blue)|
||2|Raise|Underglow RGB config(Red)|

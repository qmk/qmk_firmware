## Bootloader

The Cornia PCBs have a reset button on the bottom side near to the TRRS jack.

To enter in to the bootloader you can either:
- Hold reset when plugging in that half of the keyboard.
- Double press reset if firmware was already flashed and if RP2040 is used
- Press NAV+NUM+ESC if firmware was already flashed no matter what controller is used

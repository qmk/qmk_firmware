# Adi's XD75re Keymap

This is my own (@adiron) keymap. It was originally made for the Planck. Since then a modified layout has expanded to encompass the XD75re as well, which I mostly use.

Below is a summary of the important functions in the keymap. For more, consult the keymap file.

## Multi-use keys

Enter (thumb key) - HJKL become left, down, up, right (VIM movement keys). Q and W become previous and next tab, E and R switch spaces in macOS, A and Z go back and and forward in the browser.

Semicolon - VIM movement keys become mouse. U left click. I right click.

Quote key - JKL are back, pause/play and forward. AZ are volume up and down, Q and W are brightness down and up.

## Misc

Lower + Quote - a Hebrew maqaf (Ö¾) in macOS

## AG swap

Macros refer to AG_SWAP to check whether to send the macOS or the Windows shortcut. Very useful to me since I alternate between the two.

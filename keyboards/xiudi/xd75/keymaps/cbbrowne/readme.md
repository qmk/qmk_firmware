Much of this is copied from my Planck keymap...

1.  TODO
--------------------------------------------------

 * Set up keypad in the middle of the screen?
 * Or perhaps I should set up a layer for that?
 * Need the Random, version, my name keys
 * Almost certainly I want shift/control/alt on the right side,
   superimposed on whatever is at the rightmost end
 * Need a good place for RESET
 * Definitely want the keyboard to "breathe"
 * Perhaps nice to have some programming constructs as in jeremy-dev
   - It had C operators such as /=, *=, -=, +=, ...
 * Should I have some tmux commands like in mollat?
 * How about adding some emacs commands?

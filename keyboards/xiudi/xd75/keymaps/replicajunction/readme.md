# replicaJunction - XD75 layout

As a longtime ortho user, I prefer the "pseudo-split" keymap, where the center 3 columns are used for other purposes. This leaves 6 columns on each side to used like a split Preonic.

Most of the goodies in this layout are defined in [my userspace folder](../../../../users/replicaJunction/readme.md). Better explanations of the interesting features are provided there.

# KMontag42's XD60/XD64 Keymap and Layout

[![Built with Spacemacs](https://cdn.rawgit.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/442d025779da2f62fc86c2082703697714db6514/assets/spacemacs-badge.svg)](http://spacemacs.org)

## Additional Notes
This layout is  WIP for me as I use my shiny new keyboard more and more. I will work to keep this updated.

## Notable features
* Arrows only on the bottom row
** i prefer vim style movement, so this works well for me
* Layer based RGB lighting
** i use rgb lights to determine what layer is currently active
* Maximum key usage
** unless someone tells me otherwise, I believe this is the maximum number of keys the board can support without PCB modding
* I use emacs, which could account for some of the oddities in my layout and macros

## Build
To build the default keymap, simply run `make xiudi/xd60:kmontag42`.

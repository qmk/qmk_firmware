# dangjoeltang's Think6.5v2 keymap

My personal keymap for the Think6.5v2. Using the `LAYOUT_65_ansi_blocker` LAYOUT for a 2U blocker version. I added functionality to enable the Caps-lock indicator LED above the badge. This functionality shipped with the original board; however, for those who reflash their boards using the default `gray_studio/think65/solder` keymaps that functionality disappeared.

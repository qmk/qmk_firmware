# Personal keymap for the Think 6.5 with compatible soldered PCB

The layout is UK ISO with some small personal tweaks.

The LED cycling code is based on code posted to the Gray Studio Discord by `MudkipMao` on Nov 22nd 2019. Thanks!

## LED cycling

This map saves and restores your current active LED group choice to user EEPROM and restores it on keyboard init, which you can cycle through all combinations of, or toggle individually.

The cycle is `Off -> Esc -> Badge -> Underglow -> Esc+Badge -> Esc+Underglow -> Badge+Underglow -> All`. Look at the keymap for the controls on layer 1.

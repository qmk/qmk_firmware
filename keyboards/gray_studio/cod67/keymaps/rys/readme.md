# Rys's keymap for a COD67

The COD67 supports really nice RGB underglow which you can see through the mid diffuser. I've put control for that on layer 1, along with reset on `Space`, backlight toggle on `Enter`, and the function row. The board supports all of the QMK RGB effects.

Look at the excellent [RGB Lighting](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight) docs on the QMK site for more controls.

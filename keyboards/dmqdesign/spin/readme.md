Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make dmqdesign/spin:default

    OR
    
    make dmqdesign/spin:default:dfu

    
I have two example keymaps available, both the default and the encoderLayers keymap which demonstrates using different encoder functions based on the layer chosen.    

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).

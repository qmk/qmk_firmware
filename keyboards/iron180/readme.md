# Iron180 QMK folder

## Introduction

This is the QMK Firmware repository for the Iron180 PCB, a keyboard designed by [Smith and Rune](https://smithrune.com/) and PCB designed by [Gondolindrim](http://github.com/Gondolindrim).

The Iron180 PCB is a F13 TKL PCB with ALPS switches support. It also supports in-switch single-color LEDs and a multi-layout design for default or 7U bottom row, ISO layout, split backspace and right shift.

As of November 2020, the only way to obtain an Iron180 was through the [Group Buy](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=109513) which is already over and all spots were filled.

## How to compile

After setting up your build environment, you can compile the Iron180 default keymap by using:

    make iron180:default

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).

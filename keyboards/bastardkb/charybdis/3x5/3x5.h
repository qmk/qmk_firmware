/**
 * \brief Compatibility layout with the split_3x5_3 community layout.
 *
 * This effectively renders the Charbdis Nano compatible with existing layout
 * implementations relying on the `split_3x5_3` layout, which includes, among
 * others, Manna-Harbour's (@manna_harbour) Miryoku layout.
 *
 * The last key on the layout is ignored, to transform the input 36-keys layout
 * into the Charybdis Nano's 35-keys layout.

# Space and "Red" modifier are keys I want in the easiest-to-reach position in
# the thumb row. Depending on the angle and height of the Mitosis and the type
# of keycaps you use, the upper row or the lower row of thumb keys might be more
# comfortable for you. I put red/space on the upper row and blue/shift on the
# lower, but to swap that, set MITOSIS_DATAGROK_BOTTOMSPACE = yes. This has the
# effect of swapping only the four center keys on the upper row of thumb keys with that
# of the lower row of thumb keys.

# I used to use a pro micro clocked at 8Mhz. It can't reach the same baud rate
# that the standard 16Mhz-clocked pro micro can, so the baud rate needs to be

These docs are for the QMK version of the E6-V2 PCB. [More info on qmk.fm](http://qmk.fm/)

The E6V2 has been available with either a bootmapper client or QMK powered PCB. During the second round, the QMK powered PCB was redesigned and used different ports and a different switch matrix. 

Please use the appropriate version when making your firmware. Flashing one in place of the other, can brick your PCB. Please be certain whether you have a OE or LE  PCB. 

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/build_environment_setup.html) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/make_instructions.html) for more information.

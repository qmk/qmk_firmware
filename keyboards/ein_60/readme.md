The Ein_60 is a 50 key ergo style column stagger keyboard PCB with a combined split layout that is designed to fit into a standard 60% tray mount case. It has USB C and comes in either hotswap or soldered versions. (Soldered version is Alps and MX compatible.) It can have two encoders in either of it's middle keys and an OLED installed in the center below the plate. The PCB supports a bottom mounted KELIKING KLJ-1102 low profile buzzer speaker for audio effects. It has 38 side facing LEDs around the entire outside edge of the PCB for very bright RGB effects as well as solder points for LED strips. The Ein_60 is compatible with the majority of Planck keycap sets and can have a 1U only layout, two 2U and two 1U, or two 3U keys in the thumb cluster (or any combination of those). 


When flashing the Ein_60 use: make ein_60:default:flash

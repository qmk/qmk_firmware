A budget-minded, 4-8 key macro-pad with built in legs, plate & case.

Supports MX & Alps switches. 2x 1u or 1x 2u supported for each row.

Supports 2u PCB-Mount stabilizers.

Runs off of 1x Pro Micro & 8x diodes (1n4148).

Optional "Reset" switch can be used on the PCB.

A fantastic project for beginners to learn to solder, veteran's of the hobby who want to add an easy macro-pad to their collection, and everyone in between.

Due to PCB tolerance issues outside of our control, the snap-apart legs included on the PCB may need extra padding to prevent a small amount of wobbling once placed properly. We have included small, clear, and semi-permanent "glue dots" in each order (PCB Only -and- Full Kit) to help with this. You may also use plastic wrap, tape, Elmer's glue, hot glue, rubber cement, etc. We advise against using anything more "permanent" in case you wish to make changes to your Launch Pad in the future. It is also best to attach legs after all of your soldering and building is finished, to get the most accurate feel for your Launch Pad.

# ResFury Let's Split, Eh Layout

This layout specializes the Let's Split, Eh for Colevrak users that occasionally let others play with their toys. Adjust layer allows swapping to Colemak/Dvorak/Qwerty alphas. Heavily influenced by the default planck layout, but with up/down switched, a left hand 10-key, remapped backspace, and a few convenience keys.

Master set by EE_HANDS method.

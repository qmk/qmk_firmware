The Keebmonkey KBMG68 should be the cheapest gasket keyboard you can ever have. Both the plate and the PCB are gasket mounted, resulting in a deep thocky sound. The shell of the kit is made of 6-layers of acrylic boards, leaving huge space for modding and continuous improvements (even though this kit already sounds perfect when it's out of the box).

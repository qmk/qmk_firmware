kitten_paw
==========

This is the firmware for the 2016 revision of the Kitten Paw controller by Bathroom Epiphanies. Most of the boilerplate code is the work of [BathroomEpiphanies](https://github.com/BathroomEpiphanies).

NKRO doesn't work at the moment, I don't know if I will take the time to find out how to fix this, so far 6KRO is enough for me.

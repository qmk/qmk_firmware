# BOX75 QMK firmware folder

## Introduction

This is the QMK firmware repository for the BOX75, a keyboard designed by [Lin Design Studio](https://www.instagram.com/lin_designstudio/?hl=en). The PCB was designed by [Gondolindrim](https://github.com/Gondolindrim).

The BOX75 is a 75% keyboard featuring a sleek exterior inspired by modern architecture. It supports MX-type switches only with no lighting options. Layout-wise, the BOX75 supports ISO layouts, split backspace and split right shift and three bottom row options (6u, 6.25u, 7u).

As of november 2020, the only way to obtain a BOX75 is through the still upcoming Group Buy on [Novelkeys](http://novelkeys.xyz).

## How to compile

After setting up your build environment, you can compile the BOX75 default keymap by using:

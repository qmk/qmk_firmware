# Keelhauler's Preonic layout

## Aims to provide a more seamless transition from a normal full-size keyboard and layout to the otholinear 50% layout of the preonic than the stock keymap.

## Includes some personal touches that I find more helpful than the stock keymaps.

### Base Keymap Improvements

    FN key removed
    Bottom left redesign from FN, CTRL, ALT, OS to CTRL, OS, ALT, PSCR
    Enter functions as RShift when held, Enter when tapped

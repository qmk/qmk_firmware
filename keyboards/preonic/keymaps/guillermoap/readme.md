# Preonic Double Spacebar HHKB layout mainly for programming
This layout is highly curated to my needs and what I like. I mainly use it for programming in macOS, but also gaming in Windows.

The main concept behind every key position is to be able to maximize how many things I can do without lifting my hands from the home row.
## Layers
### Base
- Ctrl/Cmd is on the Caps Lock place (HHKB like)
- Enter and Space are in the double space bar
- Normal arrows position (not vim-like)
- Left Shift on hold - Caps Lock Toggle on tap
- Vertical scroll on encoder
### Gaming
- Switched Enter and Space to reach more easily when gaming
- Left Shift doesn't have Caps Lock toggle
- ` is in Ctrl space, mainly used for Push To Talk in games
### Lower
- Main programming symbols with right hand
- Media controls with left hand
- Full F1..F12 Function keys on number row
- Ctrl + C | Ctrl + Z Macros to avoid having to constantly press encoder
- Ctrl + Tab | Ctrl + Shift + Tab on encoder
### Raise
- Arrow keys on JKLI
- Home End PgUp PgDown on M,.Up
- Numbers on asdfgqwert
- Del on BackSpace
- Horizontal scroll on encoder
### Config
- Swap Ctrl and GUI on H so I have Cmd next to KC_A when on MacOS
- Unswap Ctrl and GUI on G so I have Ctrl next to KC_A when on Windows
- J switches to BASE layer
- K switches to GAMING layer
- Default Config for Preonic

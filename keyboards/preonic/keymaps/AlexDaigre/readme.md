# Alex Daigre's programming Layout

The default Preonic layout is suited to general english typing but not very convent to program on. This is my custom layout to re-optimise the keyboard for programming tasks.
I have been programming with this keyboard layout at work and I found it much faster and easier to adjust to than the default layout.

- Removed keys on the RAISE, LOWER, and ADJUST layers that duplicated keys on the main QWERTY layout.
- Moved the control, alt, and gui keys to a more natural position.
- Added the Caps-lock key on RAISE and LOWER in its position on a standard keyboard.
- Moved {}[], -_, and \| (on RAISE and LOWER) to be close to to similar keys on the QWERTY layout to make them easier to remember. They are kept as close as possible to their locations on a standard layout so users won't have to ADJUST their muscle memory much.
    - (), {}, and [] are all on the 9 and 0 keys. This is where () are placed naturally, so it is easy to find all of your braces.
    - -_ are moved to the += key. Now you can remember that -, +, and = are all together. The keys are also right next to each-other on a standard layout, so it is a very small move.
    - \ and | have beeb moved to the /? key. Easy to remember as / and \ are together.
- Moved backspace to make room for +=.
- Added delete to the backspace key on RAISE / LOWER
- Removed backlight, from the main layer, and added an ADJUST key. As the Massdrop kits don't come with backlighting default, I think this is more useful for most users.
- I have left the Colemak and Dvorak alternate layouts, but they won't map up as conveniently to the other layers.
- I have included the keyboard layouts so that those wishing to make modifications or new versions of this layout can quickly update their images.

# Snowskeleton Preonic Layout (with Rotery Encoder)
This layout aims to optimize several corner cases where the default layout falls short.
This is a opinionated layout, designed for efficient coding in English.
As such, several internationalizations have been removed,
and you may wish to add them back in when adjusting to your language.

Special notes:

the Enter key is only accessable through alternate layers,
but there it is available on both sides of the board (depending on the layer).

Numbers and their coorisponding symbols (1 and !, 2 and @, etc) can be typed several ways.
Each is available on its own layer,
while still following Shift key convention.

Vim-like arrow keys on Raise layer.

Instead of having a separate layout for Windows,
I only support swapping the Gui and Alt keys.
This provides 99% of the functionality without requiring the maintainence of two separate layouts.

# OLKB Preonic Rev3 layout by mechmaster48

- A simple layout largely based on the default with minor tweaks to fit my typing.
- The esacpe key has been moved to the top left, ctrl and alt moved to bottom left, and enter key has been moved up one space underneath delete.
- Colemak and Dvorak layers have been removed in this keymap as I do not and will not use them.

# A preonic layout similar to the default,

but with some extra conviences for programming and gaming

## For programming

* Underscore is next to space.
* Backslash replaces Del on the default layer.
* Brackets are easy to reach, and are arranged symmetrically.

## For Gaming

* Gaming mode disables OS key.
* Gaming mode moves ALT to "right space", to be more easily reached.
* Numpad is available with only the left hand (for emotes).

## Personal taste

* Esc is in the top left, where it belongs
* Only one Alt layer and one Func layer
* Function codes are mnemonic
  * Func + G for Game mode
  * Func + M for Music mode
  * Func + N for Num lock
* No multi-key combos with more than two keys

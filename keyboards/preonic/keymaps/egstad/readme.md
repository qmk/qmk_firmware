# Egstad's Layout

## Build

- Cd into this directory, run `npm start`
- Cd into root with `npm run qmk`, locate bin file "preonic_rev3_egstad.bin"
- Drop that bin into QMK Toolbox and flash Keeb

## Learnings

 1. Combos â€” Don't fuck with 'em. They made my keys feel sticky and increased typos. Would be great on macropad or something tho!

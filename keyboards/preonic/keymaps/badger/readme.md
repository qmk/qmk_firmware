# A QWERTY-centric preonic layout by [BlueTufa](https://github.com/BlueTufa)

## Layouts

### QWERTY 
Standard QWERTY layer, but ESC maps to MOVE layer when held down.  Dedicated modifier for Adjust layer and a dedicated OS action key.
### RAISE layer
Access to function keys and shifted characters not on Preonic layout.  Effort is taken to keep Function keys aligned with corresponding number.  Some OS action keys are available in this layer.

### LOWER layer
Numpad behavior and access to characters not present on Preonic layout.  

### MOVE layer
OS-specific convenience shortcuts.  Macros are used to make it easier to adapt these to other operating systems.
Window move and resize, and option to move to a specific virtual desktop.

### ADJUST layer
The first row is focused on audio config.
Take advantage of the mouse movement keys, as well as toggling common keyboard config settings.
Flash settings are accessed here as well.

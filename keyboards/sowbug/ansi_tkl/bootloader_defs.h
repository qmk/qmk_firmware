/* Address for jumping to bootloader on STM32 chips. */
/* It is chip dependent, the correct number can be looked up here (page 175):

 * This also requires a patch to chibios:

// STM32F103* does NOT have an USB bootloader in ROM (only serial),
//  so setting anything here does not make much sense
#define STM32_BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS 0x80000000

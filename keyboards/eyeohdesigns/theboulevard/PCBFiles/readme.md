The purpose of this project was to make a working PCB compatible with the open source case for The Ave.

Items tested:

Continuity between all keys in each row.
Continuity between all keys in each column.
Tweezer tested one key in each row and column.
Encoder functionality.

Items yet to be tested:

RGB.

Items I do not intend to test in the near future:

Tweezer test every single key. The continuity checks and the test of each key in a row and column will suffice.

Compatibility with the open source plate. I know that these PCBs fit in the case, but I don't have the time or resources to ensure everything lines up on the plate. I did take some measurements when initially staarting this project, and noticed that although the case had .25u spacing between the left most column and the main key cluster, at least one of the switch plates did not have this spacing. The PCB I designed uses .25u spacing between the left most column and the main key cluster.

Know issues:

There was supposed to be a 40s logo on the main PCB that did not turn out correctly. I'll fix this in the near future.

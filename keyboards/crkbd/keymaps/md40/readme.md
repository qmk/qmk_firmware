# MD40: Minimally Disruptive 40% Keymap

This keymap is an attempt to go from a standard keyboard layout to a 40% keyboard with minimal disruption.

Some aims:
- Two layers only
- Existing keyboard positions where possible
- Exceptions where it's not possible
- Exceptions where it makes sense

Supports crkbd only.

# crkbd oco9oco Keymap
## QWERTY Base / Home row mods
A standard qwerty layout.
All layers except Home row mod switching and Trackball assist layer can be accessed only with holding key.
Most of the modifiers are on the left side.
Based on Miryoku's home row mods, This keymap uses GACS Tap-mods for right hand. For Korean typing experience, home row mods on the left hand side have an order of SACS, which is mainly for the double consonant on the 1st alpha row(QWERT).

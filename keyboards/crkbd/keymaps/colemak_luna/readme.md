# Personal keymap for the CRKBD
My own keymap with some custom OLED features, Colemak base layer and gaming layers. The F13 key on multiple layers can be bound to something, I use it as toggle mute microphone on Discord.
## Layers
- Colemak - Default layer
- Lower - Has numbers and arrows
- Raise - Has symbols
- Game1 - A QWERTY Gaming layer
- Game2 - An alternate lower layer when Game1 is active, has numbers and other keys that may be needed 
- Adjust - Has F-keys and settings, allows to set the Game1 as base layer.

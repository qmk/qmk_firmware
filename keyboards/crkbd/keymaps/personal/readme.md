# Default keymap for Corne Keyboard

Features:

- Layout comfortable for me.
- Based on Josef Adamicik default layout.
- Spanish keyboard with all keys I use to do my job, not more nor less.
- The OLED on master half shows selected mode and caps lock state and is rotated.
- Adopted Luna the cat, modified to cover a bug, no bark, instructions [here](https://github.com/HellSingCoder/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/sofle/keymaps/helltm)
- Still testing.

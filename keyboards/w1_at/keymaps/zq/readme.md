# Personal W1-AT keymap
The main highlights are as follows:
* VIA support enabled
* Enter bootloader mode using Fn + \
* Grave key (` and ~) in place of Esc key
* Esc in place of CapsLock key
* Use NumLock LED indicator on layers: ON in layer 0, OFF in layer 2 (workaround for macOS since there is no NumLock key)
* Use CapsLock LED indicator on Esc key

About the OSA:

The OSA was run as a private group buy of 20 units. It is an Alice layout keyboard based on the Open Source Alice files, altered by BlindAssassin111 based on input from the private group buy members.
All case and other design files have been either reworked or created from scratch by BlindAssassin111. PCB was designed from scratch by BlindAssassin111.
The OSA PCB is an ATMega32u4 powered, USB Type C, Alice compatible PCB and was created specifically for the OSA case, but with considerations to make it compatible with the Lubrigante acrylic cases (except for the Type C connector it should also be compatible with original TGR Alice cases).

Keyboard Maintainer: [jrfhoutx](https://github.com/jrfhoutx)  
Hardware Supported: OSA PCB by BlindAssassin111, ATMEGA32u4  
Hardware Availability: Currently unavailable outside of the private group buy

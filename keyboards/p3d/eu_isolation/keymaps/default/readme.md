# Default layout for EU ISOlation

Fairly standard layout using all 1U keycaps for the body and of course 4 ISO
enter keys to keep things interesting.

* The 4 ISO enters are mapped to F1-F4 by default
* The ISO enters have a combo, holding the top to is volume up, the bottom two
 is volume down
* Play with the combos and ISO Enters and see what you can do!

The 78 key split keyboard from [SpiderIsland on AliExpress](https://a.aliexpress.com/_dVJsSpR).
Out of the box it runs ps2avrGB firmware, like [`split75`](../../wheatfield/split75/README.md).
It is mistakenly called "87 key" on the AliExpress title and "104 key" (?!) in the caption inside the photo.

This port is based on the `split75` port which was mostly done by [Michael L. Walker](https://github.com/walkerstop).

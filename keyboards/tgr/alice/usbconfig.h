General Description:
This file is an example configuration (with inline documentation) for the USB
driver. It configures V-USB for USB D+ connected to Port D bit 2 (which is
also hardware interrupt 0 on many devices) and USB D- to Port D bit 4. You may
wire the lines to any other port, as long as D+ is also wired to INT0 (or any
other hardware interrupt, as long as it is the highest level interrupt, see
section at the end of this file).
*/

/* ---------------------------- Hardware Config ---------------------------- */

#define USB_CFG_IOPORTNAME      D
/* This is the port where the USB bus is connected. When you configure it to
 * "B", the registers PORTB, PINB and DDRB will be used.
 */

/* This is the bit number in USB_CFG_IOPORT where the USB D+ line is connected.
 * This may be any bit in the port. Please note that D+ must also be connected
 * to interrupt pin INT0! [You can also use other interrupts, see section
 * "Optional MCU Description" below, or you can connect D- to the interrupt, as
 * it is required if you use the USB_COUNT_SOF feature. If you use D- for the
 * interrupt, the USB interrupt will also be triggered at Start-Of-Frame
 * markers every millisecond.]

 * require no crystal, they tolerate +/- 1% deviation from the nominal

 * Since F_CPU should be defined to your actual clock rate anyway, you should
 * not need to modify this setting.

 * YL and modify SREG. If it lasts longer than a couple of cycles, USB messages
 * immediately after an SOF pulse may be lost and must be retried by the host.
 * What can you do with this hook? Since the SOF signal occurs exactly every
 * 1 ms (unless the host is in sleep mode), you can use it to tune OSCCAL in
 * designs running on the internal RC oscillator.
 * Please note that Start Of Frame detection works only if D- is wired to the
 * interrupt, not D+. THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN MOST EXAMPLES!

/* ------------------- Fine Control over USB Descriptors ------------------- */
/* If you don't want to use the driver's default USB descriptors, you can

 * flash memory, (2) fixed length static data in RAM or (3) dynamically at
 * runtime in the function usbFunctionDescriptor(). See usbdrv.h for more
 * information about this function.
 * Descriptor handling is configured through the descriptor's properties. If
 * no properties are defined or if they are 0, the default descriptor is used.
 * Possible properties are:
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_DYNAMIC: The data for the descriptor should be fetched
 *     at runtime via usbFunctionDescriptor(). If the usbMsgPtr mechanism is
 *     used, the data is in FLASH by default. Add property USB_PROP_IS_RAM if
 *     you want RAM pointers.
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_RAM: The data returned by usbFunctionDescriptor() or found
 *     in static memory is in RAM, not in flash memory.
 *   + USB_PROP_LENGTH(len): If the data is in static memory (RAM or flash),
 *     the driver must know the descriptor's length. The descriptor itself is
 *     found at the address of a well known identifier (see below).
 * List of static descriptor names (must be declared PROGMEM if in flash):
 *   char usbDescriptorDevice[];
 *   char usbDescriptorConfiguration[];
 *   char usbDescriptorHidReport[];
 *   char usbDescriptorString0[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringVendor[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringDevice[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringSerialNumber[];
 * Other descriptors can't be provided statically, they must be provided
 * dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * Descriptor properties are or-ed or added together, e.g.:
 * #define USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE   (USB_PROP_IS_RAM | USB_PROP_LENGTH(18))
 *
 * The following descriptors are defined:
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_CONFIGURATION
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRINGS
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_0
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_VENDOR
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_PRODUCT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_SERIAL_NUMBER
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID_REPORT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_UNKNOWN (for all descriptors not handled by the driver)
 *
 * Note about string descriptors: String descriptors are not just strings, they
 * are Unicode strings prefixed with a 2 byte header. Example:
 * int  serialNumberDescriptor[] = {
 *     USB_STRING_DESCRIPTOR_HEADER(6),
 *     'S', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'a', 'l'
 * };

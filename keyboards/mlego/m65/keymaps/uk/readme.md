This is the default layout for M65. For the most part it's a straightforward and easy to follow layout inspired by ISO with a UK
turn.  The only unusual key is the key in the upper left, which sends Escape normally, but Grave when in layer 1 aka LWR.  Similarly
number row in layer 1 give the usual audio KC_GRV, KC_AUDIO_MUTE,  KC_AUDIO_VOL_UP,  KC_AUDIO_VOL_DOWN,   KC_MEDIA_PREV_TRACK,
KC_MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE,  KC_MEDIA_NEXT_TRACK, M_EXTDISP,  KC_SYSTEM_SLEEP, KC_SYSTEM_WAKE, KC_PRINT_SCREEN, KC_DEL, KC_EQL in layer 2 aka
RSE one gets F1-F12 mouse emulation can be used in layer 1 and 2.

flashing is done by LWR+RSE+r

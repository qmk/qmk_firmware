This is for those who insist to use keyboard with ÅÄÖ. Also thought about the
gaming aspect with this keyboard, therefore space on left side.

At first I thought about having backspace in the upper right corner of the
slave side, but that made it really clunky to fix your text. Thumbs should take
care of this job instead.

# EosTi's Iris Layout

## Features

- QWERTY base layer with right thumb space and left thumb enter
- Gaming layer to swap enter and space so that WASD and space can all be on the same hand
- MacOS navigation keys for switching windows and entering Mission Control
- Browser navigation keys for cycling tabs
- HJKL arrow keys
- tmux navigation keys for switching focus, panes
- Plays nicely with my Planck layout for easy switching
- Probably other stuff too?

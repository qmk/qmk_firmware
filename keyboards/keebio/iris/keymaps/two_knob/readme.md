# Two Knob Keymap for Iris Rev6a
![two_knobs](https://i.imgur.com/JqGPWCn.png)

This keymap is derived from Ergodox layouts and is adapted for the [Iris6a](https://docs.keeb.io/iris-rev6-build-guide). It is notable for it's semi-complex programming examples that include the use of rotary encoders.

Plenty of useful examples:
* Advanced knob programming! (Three-layer usage + clicks)
* Advanced RGB! (Per-key lighting)
* Macros! (Fancy key combos tied to the rotary encoders)
* Tap Dance! (Double tap your '5' key for 'Enter')
* Dynamic Tapping term! (Dial in the double tap speed)

The qwerty key layout is my adaptation of the ergodox defaults. If this is your first split keyboard, you probably want a different key layout. 

I stopped using the fancy RGB programming pretty quickly. It was a complex to get working initially, so I'm leaving the examples here for others. (As a touch typist - not terribly helpful, but it looks nice). YMMV.

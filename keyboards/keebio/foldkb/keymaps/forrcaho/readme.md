# Keebio FoldKB rev1

My layout for the FoldKB has three layers:

* A default standard QWERTY layer, 

* a second "programming" layer with
    * function keys for the corresponding numbers
    * arrow and other navigation keys (such as home) on the right half, and
    * various alternate keymappings and macros useful for programming on the
    left half.

* a third "mouse" layer with mouse keys on the right half. No special functions
have been added to the left half for this layer (yet).

This was written for a FoldKB with one encoder, and that is made to function as
a mouse scroll wheel on all layers. Pressing it is a mouse left click and
shift-pressing it is a mouse right click. (Presumably both encoders would do the
same thing on a FoldKB with two.)

The backgound lighting levels indicate the layer: dimmest for the default
QWERTY layer, middle brightness for the mouse layer, and brightest for the
programming layer.

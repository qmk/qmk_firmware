This keymap turns RGB underglow and per-key RGB ON at the same time.

While this is the case:

RGB_TOG, RGB_MOD, etc to control the RGB underglow

F13-F17 were used to control the per key RGB 

- F13 to turn the RGB on/off
- F14 to change the effect mode
- F15 to increase the HUE
- F16 to increase the SAT
- F17 to increase the VAL

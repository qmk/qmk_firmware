It's a DIY, QMK Powered Trackball!!!!

* Keyboard Maintainer: [PloopyCo](https://github.com/ploopyco), [Drashna Jael're](https://github.com/drashna/), [Germ](https://github.com/germ/)
* Hardware Supported: ATMega32u4 8MHz(3.3v)  
* Hardware Availability: [Store](https://ploopy.co), [GitHub](https://github.com/ploopyco)

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make ploopyco/trackball/rev1:default:flash
    make ploopyco/trackball/rev1_005:default:flash
    
To jump to the bootloader, hold down "Button 4" (immediate right of the trackball)

## Revisions

There are two main revisions for the PloopyCo Tracball, everything up to 1.004, and 1.005.   

In the 1.005 revision, button for was changed from pin B5 to B6, and the debug LED pin was changed from F7 to B5. 

The PCB should indicate which revision this is.

# Customzing your PloopyCo Trackball

While the defaults are designed so that it can be plugged in and used right away, there are a number of things that you may want to change.  Such as adding DPI control, or to use the ball to scroll while holding a button.   To allow for this sort of control, there is a callback for both the scroll wheel and the mouse sensor. 

The default behavior for this is:

```c
void process_wheel_user(report_mouse_t* mouse_report, int16_t h, int16_t v) {
    mouse_report->h = h;
    mouse_report->v = v;
}

void process_mouse_user(report_mouse_t* mouse_report, int16_t x, int16_t y) {
    mouse_report->x = x;
    mouse_report->y = y;
}
```

This should allow you to more heavily customize the behavior. 

Alternatively, the `process_wheel` and `process_mouse` functions can both be replaced too, to allow for even more functionality.

Additionally, you can change the DPI/CPI or speed of the trackball by calling `pmw_set_cpi` at any time. Additionally, there is a `DPI_CONFIG` macro that will cycle through an array of options for the DPI.  This is set to 1200, 1600, and 2400, but can be changed.  1600 is also set to the default. 

To configure/set your own array, there are two defines to use, `PLOOPY_DPI_OPTIONS` to set the array, and `PLOOPY_DPI_DEFAULT`. 

```c
#define PLOOPY_DPI_OPTIONS { 1200, 1600, 2400 }
#define PLOOPY_DPI_DEFAULT 1
```
The `PLOOPY_DPI_OPTIONS` array sets the values that you want to be able to cycle through, and the order they are in.  The "default" define lets the firmware know which of these options is the default and should be loaded by default. 

The `DPI_CONFIG` macro will cycle through the values in the array, each time you hit it.  And it stores this value in persistent memory, so it will load it the next time the device powers up.

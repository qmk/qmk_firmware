# The keymap that takes commands as LED-Key BitMasks (lkbm)
Based on [maddie](../maddie), this keymap lets you send a 2-bit command by having a macro on your keyboard tap `KC_NUM_LOCK` and `KC_CAPS_LOCK` on and off within a very short window (25ms by default) to represent bits 1 and 2 respectively.  The keymap uses this to allow toggling between sending mouse-movement events and scrolling events; cycling DPI presets, and resetting to the bootloader, so you can reflash without having to unscrew your Ploopy Nano.

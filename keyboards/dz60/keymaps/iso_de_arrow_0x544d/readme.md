# DZ60 - ISO DE Arrow Layout

![DZ60 ISO DE Arrow Layout Image](https://i.imgur.com/rfQRr7n.png)

This is a modified version of the ISO DE layout for the DZ60 board. It has dedicated
arrow keys and standard spacebar and backspace keys.

The keyboard uses a hardware layout with dedicated arrow keys. To accomplish that, the key on the
left of the "UP arrow" key serves a dual purpose as "-\_" when pressed short and as "RShift" key
when you hold the key. To trigger the "underscore" you need to hold LShift and press "-\_".

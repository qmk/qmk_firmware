# The Bongo Cat WPM Layout!

If you're looking for the Bongo Cat/WPM Counter firmware for your Nibble, this is it! The OLED occupies the bottom two left macro key spots, so there isn't anything assigned. However, if you've manually wired the oled to a different position, you can assign keys to those locations. This uses the default keymap layout so everything is where you expect it to be.

Now optimized to fit VIA support! This uses the [squeez-o](https://github.com/nullbitsco/squeez-o) tool to compress the animation frames, which reduces their program memory usage by a large amount.

# Debugging FAQ

This page details various common questions people have about troubleshooting their keyboards.

# Debug Console

## `hid_listen` Can't Recognize Device
When debug console of your device is not ready you will see like this:

```
Waiting for device:.........
```

once the device is plugged in then *hid_listen* finds it you will get this message:

```
Waiting for new device:.........................
Listening:
```

If you can't get this 'Listening:' message try building with `CONSOLE_ENABLE=yes` in [Makefile]

You may need privilege to access the device on OS like Linux.
- try `sudo hid_listen`

## Can't Get Message on Console
Check:
- *hid_listen* finds your device. See above.
- Enable debug with pressing **Magic**+d. See [Magic Commands](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard#magic-commands).
- set `debug_enable=true` usually in `matrix_init()` in **matrix.c**.
- try using 'print' function instead of debug print. See **common/print.h**.
- disconnect other devices with console function. See [Issue #97](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/issues/97).

## Linux or UNIX Like System Requires Super User Privilege
Just use 'sudo' to execute *hid_listen* with privilege.
```
$ sudo hid_listen
```

Or add an *udev rule* for TMK devices with placing a file in rules directory. The directory may vary on each system.

File: /etc/udev/rules.d/52-tmk-keyboard.rules(in case of Ubuntu)
```
# tmk keyboard products     https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="feed", MODE:="0666"
```

## Safety Considerations

You probably don't want to "brick" your keyboard, making it impossible
to rewrite firmware onto it.  Here are some of the parameters to show
what things are (and likely aren't) too risky.

- If your keyboard map does not include RESET, then, to get into DFU
  mode, you will need to press the reset button on the PCB, which
  requires unscrewing the bottom.
- Messing with tmk_core / common files might make the keyboard
  inoperable
- Too large a .hex file is trouble; `make dfu` will erase the block,
  test the size (oops, wrong order!), which errors out, failing to
  flash the keyboard, leaving it in DFU mode.
  - To this end, note that the maximum .hex file size on Planck is
    7000h (28672 decimal)

```
Linking: .build/planck_rev4_cbbrowne.elf                                                            [OK]
Creating load file for Flash: .build/planck_rev4_cbbrowne.hex                                       [OK]

Size after:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
      0   22396       0   22396    577c planck_rev4_cbbrowne.hex
```

  - The above file is of size 22396/577ch, which is less than
    28672/7000h
  - As long as you have a suitable alternative .hex file around, you
    can retry, loading that one
  - Some of the options you might specify in your keyboard's Makefile
    consume extra memory; watch out for BOOTMAGIC_ENABLE,
    MOUSEKEY_ENABLE, EXTRAKEY_ENABLE, CONSOLE_ENABLE, API_SYSEX_ENABLE
- DFU tools do /not/ allow you to write into the bootloader (unless
  you throw in extra fruit salad of options), so there is little risk
  there.
- EEPROM has around a 100000 write cycle.  You shouldn't rewrite the
  firmware repeatedly and continually; that'll burn the EEPROM
  eventually.

## NKRO Doesn't work
First you have to compile firmware with this build option `NKRO_ENABLE` in **Makefile**.

Try `Magic` **N** command(`LShift+RShift+N` by default) when **NKRO** still doesn't work. You can use this command to toggle between **NKRO** and **6KRO** mode temporarily. In some situations **NKRO** doesn't work you need to switch to **6KRO** mode, in particular when you are in BIOS.

If your firmware built with `BOOTMAGIC_ENABLE` you need to turn its switch on by `BootMagic` **N** command(`Space+N` by default). This setting is stored in EEPROM and kept over power cycles.

## TrackPoint Needs Reset Circuit (PS/2 Mouse Support)
Without reset circuit you will have inconsistent result due to improper initialize of the hardware. See circuit schematic of TPM754.

## Can't Read Column of Matrix Beyond 16
Use `1UL<<16` instead of `1<<16` in `read_cols()` in [matrix.h] when your columns goes beyond 16.

In C `1` means one of [int] type which is [16 bit] in case of AVR so you can't shift left more than 15. You will get unexpected zero when you say `1<<16`. You have to use [unsigned long] type with `1UL`.

## Bootloader Jump Doesn't Work
Properly configure bootloader size in **Makefile**. With wrong section size bootloader won't probably start with **Magic command** and **Boot Magic**.
```
# Size of Bootloaders in bytes:
#   Atmel DFU loader(ATmega32U4)   4096
#   Atmel DFU loader(AT90USB128)   8192
#   LUFA bootloader(ATmega32U4)    4096
#   Arduino Caterina(ATmega32U4)   4096
#   USBaspLoader(ATmega***)        2048
#   Teensy   halfKay(ATmega32U4)   512
#   Teensy++ halfKay(AT90USB128)   2048
OPT_DEFS += -DBOOTLOADER_SIZE=4096
```
AVR Boot section size are defined by setting **BOOTSZ** fuse in fact. Consult with your MCU datasheet.
Note that **Word**(2 bytes) size and address are used in datasheet while TMK uses **Byte**.

AVR Boot section is located at end of Flash memory like the followings.
```

If you are using a TeensyUSB, there is a [known bug](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/164) in which the hardware reset button prevents the RESET key from working. Unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in should resolve the problem.

## Special Extra Key Doesn't Work (System, Audio Control Keys)
You need to define `EXTRAKEY_ENABLE` in `rules.mk` to use them in QMK.

```
EXTRAKEY_ENABLE = yes          # Audio control and System control
```

## Wakeup from Sleep Doesn't Work

In Windows check `Allow this device to wake the computer` setting in Power **Management property** tab of **Device Manager**. Also check BIOS setting.

Pressing any key during sleep should wake host.

## Using Arduino?

**Note that Arduino pin naming is different from actual chip.** For example, Arduino pin `D0` is not `PD0`. Check circuit with its schematics yourself.

- http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-leonardo-schematic_3b.pdf
- http://arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino-micro-schematic.pdf

Arduino Leonardo and micro have **ATMega32U4** and can be used for TMK, though Arduino bootloader may be a problem.

## Enabling JTAG

By default, the JTAG debugging interface is disabled as soon as the keyboard starts up. JTAG-capable MCUs come from the factory with the `JTAGEN` fuse set, and it takes over certain pins of the MCU that the board may be using for the switch matrix, LEDs, etc.

If you would like to keep JTAG enabled, just add the following to your `config.h`:

```c
#define NO_JTAG_DISABLE
```

## Adding LED Indicators of Lock Keys
You need your own LED indicators for CapsLock, ScrollLock and NumLock? See this post.

http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/tmk-keyboard-firmware-collection-t4478-120.html#p191560

## Program Arduino Micro/Leonardo
Push reset button and then run command like this within 8 seconds.

```
avrdude -patmega32u4 -cavr109 -b57600 -Uflash:w:adb_usb.hex -P/dev/ttyACM0
```

Device name will vary depending on your system.

## USB 3 Compatibility
I heard some people have a problem with USB 3 port, try USB 2 port.


## Mac Compatibility
### OS X 10.11 and Hub
https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=14290.msg1884034#msg1884034


## Problem on BIOS (UEFI)/Resume (Sleep & Wake)/Power Cycles
Some people reported their keyboard stops working on BIOS and/or after resume(power cycles).

As of now root of its cause is not clear but some build options seem to be related. In Makefile try to disable those options like `CONSOLE_ENABLE`, `NKRO_ENABLE`, `SLEEP_LED_ENABLE` and/or others.

# QMK Syllabus

This page helps you build up your QMK knowledge by introducing the basics first and guiding you to understanding all the concepts you need to know to be proficient with QMK.

# Beginning Topics

If you read nothing else you should read the documents in this section. After reading the [Tutorial](newbs.md) you should be able to create a basic keymap, compile it, and flash it to your keyboard. The remaining documents will flesh out your knowledge of these basics.

* **Learn How To Use QMK Tools**
    * [Tutorial](newbs.md)
    * [CLI](cli.md)

    * [Eclipse](other_eclipse.md)
    * [VS Code](other_vscode.md)

# Intermediate Topics

These topics start to dig into some of the features that QMK supports. You don't have to read all of these documents, but some of the documents in the Advanced Topics section won't make sense if you skip over some of these.

# Documentation Templates

This page documents the templates you should use when submitting new Keymaps and Keyboards to QMK.

## Keymap `readme.md` Template :id=keyboard-readmemd-template

Most keymaps have an image depicting the layout. You can use [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://keyboard-layout-editor.com) to create an image. Upload it to [Imgur](https://imgur.com) or another hosting service, please do not include images in your Pull Request.

Below the image you should write a short description to help people understand your keymap.

# Default Clueboard Layout

This is the default layout that comes flashed on every Clueboard. For the most
part it's a straightforward and easy to follow layout. The only unusual key is
the key in the upper left, which sends Escape normally, but Grave when any of
the Ctrl, Alt, or GUI modifiers are held down.

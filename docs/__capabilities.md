# Documentation Capabilities

This page lays out the capabilities used by the QMK Firmware documentation, in order to aid future transitions to other page generators. Focuses mainly on things other than normal Markdown, as it's assumed that markdown generators should still function accordingly.

## Overall capabilities

Unrelated to styling, high-level tech.

* Title anchors -- `:id=some-anchor-name`, used for direct linking to sections
    * Links to anchors:
        * Style 1: [early initialization](platformdev_chibios_earlyinit.md?id=board-init)
        * Style 2: [early initialization](platformdev_chibios_earlyinit.md#board-init)
        * Links to anchors on the same page, i.e. [Emoji](#emoji)
* Specifying CNAME for root domain -- `docs.qmk.fm`
* Moved pages, see `index.html`
* Text search
* Footnotes [like this][1]

### Lists

Newlines with `<br>`:

Line one<br>
Line two<br/>
Line three

Nested dotted:

* The PR is complete and ready to merge
* GitHub checks for the PR are green whenever possible
    * A "red" check may be disregarded by maintainers if the items flagged are unrelated to the change proposed in the PR
        * Modifications to existing files should not need to add license headers to pass lint, for instance.
        * If it's not directly related to your PR's functionality, prefer avoiding making a change.

Nested dashed:

- The PR is complete and ready to merge
- GitHub checks for the PR are green whenever possible
    - A "red" check may be disregarded by maintainers if the items flagged are unrelated to the change proposed in the PR
        - Modifications to existing files should not need to add license headers to pass lint, for instance.
        - If it's not directly related to your PR's functionality, prefer avoiding making a change.

Nested numbered:

1. The PR is complete and ready to merge
1. GitHub checks for the PR are green whenever possible
    1. A "red" check may be disregarded by maintainers if the items flagged are unrelated to the change proposed in the PR
        1. Modifications to existing files should not need to add license headers to pass lint, for instance.
        1. If it's not directly related to your PR's functionality, prefer avoiding making a change.
        
Nested mixed:

1. Add it to the schema in `data/schemas/keyboards.jsonschema`
1. Add a mapping in `data/maps`
1. (optional and discouraged) Add code to extract/generate it to:
  * `lib/python/qmk/info.py`
  * `lib/python/qmk/cli/generate/config_h.py`
  * `lib/python/qmk/cli/generate/rules_mk.py`

### Emoji {#emoji}

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to read this and contribute! üéâüëç

#### As colon-name-colon:

:heavy_check_mark: : works and was tested

:o: : does not apply

:x: : not supported by MCU

### XML Entities

## Styling

### CSS-ish

|----------|----------|
| Left     | Right    |

### Indented sections

> Indent without any sort of marker

!> Notification, damnit!

::: info
This is an info box.

### Keyboard keys

<kbd>,</kbd>

<kbd>Right Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Right Shift</kbd>

1. Click <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>New</kbd> > <kbd>Makefile Project with Existing Code</kbd>

1. Click <kbd><kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>Preferences ></kbd> > <kbd>Settings</kbd> </kbd>

1. Hit Ctrl-<code>&#96;</code> (Grave) to bring up the terminal or go to <kbd><kbd>View</kbd> > <kbd>Terminal</kbd></kbd> (command `workbench.action.terminal.toggleTerminal`). A new terminal will be opened if there isn‚Äòt one already.

   This should start the terminal in the workspace's folder (so the `qmk_firmware` folder), and then you can compile your keyboard. 


### Code Blocks

Inline code with tag: <code>test</code>

Inline code with backticks: `test`

    This is preformatted
    Indented by 4 spaces
    The letters lined up

```c
int c_code(void) {
    return -1;
}
```

```makefile
ifeq ($(BUILD),)
     CHUNDER_REQUIRED = yes
endif
```

```python
from pathlib import Path

p = Path('/path/to/qmk_firmware')
```

```json

    "a": "b",
    "c": 4,
    "d": {
        "e": [
            0, 1, 2, 3
        ]
    }
}
```

```diff

# Support

If you need help with something, the best place to get quick support is going to be on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Uq7gcHh).  There is usually somebody online, and there are a bunch of very helpful people there.

Don't forget to read our [Code of Conduct](https://qmk.fm/coc/).

## Help! I don't know where to start! 

If this is the case, then you should start with our [Newbs Guide](newbs.md). There is a lot of great info there, and that should cover everything you need to get started.

If that's an issue, hop onto the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm), as that will handle a majority of what you need there. 

## Help! I'm having issues flashing!

First, head to the [Compiling/Flashing FAQ Page](faq_build.md). There is a good deal of info there, and you'll find a bunch of solutions to common issues there. 

## Help, I have an issue that isn't covered by the links above

Okay, that's fine. Then please check the [open issues in our GitHub](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues) to see if somebody is experiencing the same thing (make sure it's not just similar, but actually the same).  

If you can't find anything, then please open a [new issue](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/new)!

## What if I found a bug? 

Then please open an [issue](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/new), and if you know how to fix it, open up a Pull Request on GitHub with the fix.

## But `git` and `GitHub` are intimidating! 

Don't worry, we have some pretty nice [Guidelines](newbs_git_best_practices.md) on how to start using `git` and GitHub to make things easier to develop. 

Additionally, you can find additional `git` and GitHub related links [here](newbs_learn_more_resources.md).

## I have a Keyboard that I want to add support for

Awesome! Open up a Pull Request for it. We'll review the code, and merge it!  

### What if I want to do brand it with `QMK`? 

That's amazing! We would love to assist you with that! 

In fact, we have a [whole page](https://qmk.fm/powered/) dedicated to adding QMK Branding to your page and keyboard. This covers pretty much everything you need (knowledge and images) to officially support QMK.

If you have any questions about this, open an issue or head to [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uq7gcHh).

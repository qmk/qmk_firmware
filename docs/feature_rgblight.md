# RGB Lighting

QMK has the ability to control RGB LEDs attached to your keyboard. This is commonly called *underglow*, due to the LEDs often being mounted on the bottom of the keyboard, producing a nice diffused effect when combined with a translucent case.

![Planck with RGB Underglow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/3774a7fcdab5544fc787f4c200be05fcd417e31f/keyboards/planck/keymaps/yang/planck-with-rgb-underglow.jpg)

Some keyboards come with RGB LEDs preinstalled. Others must have them installed after the fact. See the [Hardware Modification](#hardware-modification) section for information on adding RGB lighting to your keyboard.

Currently QMK supports the following addressable LEDs (however, the white LED in RGBW variants is not supported):

 * WS2811, WS2812, WS2812B, WS2812C, etc.
 * SK6812, SK6812MINI, SK6805
 * APA102

These LEDs are called "addressable" because instead of using a wire per color, each LED contains a small microchip that understands a special protocol sent over a single wire. The chip passes on the remaining data to the next LED, allowing them to be chained together. In this way, you can easily control the color of the individual LEDs.

## Usage

On keyboards with onboard RGB LEDs, it is usually enabled by default. If it is not working for you, check that your `rules.mk` includes the following:

```make
RGBLIGHT_ENABLE = yes
```

?> There are additional configuration options for ARM controllers that offer increased performance over the default WS2812 bitbang driver. Please see [WS2812 Driver](ws2812_driver.md) for more information.

For APA102 LEDs, add the following to your `rules.mk`:

```make
RGBLIGHT_ENABLE = yes
RGBLIGHT_DRIVER = apa102
```

At minimum you must define the data pin your LED strip is connected to, and the number of LEDs in the strip, in your `config.h`. For APA102 LEDs, you must also define the clock pin. If your keyboard has onboard RGB LEDs, and you are simply creating a keymap, you usually won't need to modify these.

|Define         |Description                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`WS2812_DI_PIN`|The pin connected to the data pin of the LEDs (WS2812)                   |
|`APA102_DI_PIN`|The pin connected to the data pin of the LEDs (APA102)                   |
|`APA102_CI_PIN`|The pin connected to the clock pin of the LEDs (APA102)                  |
|`RGBLED_NUM`   |The number of LEDs connected                                             |
|`RGBLED_SPLIT` |(Optional) For split keyboards, the number of LEDs connected on each half|

Then you should be able to use the keycodes below to change the RGB lighting to your liking.

### Color Selection

QMK uses [Hue, Saturation, and Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) to select colors rather than RGB. The color wheel below demonstrates how this works.

<img src="gitbook/images/color-wheel.svg" alt="HSV Color Wheel" width="250"/>

Changing the **Hue** cycles around the circle.<br>
Changing the **Saturation** moves between the inner and outer sections of the wheel, affecting the intensity of the color.<br>
Changing the **Value** sets the overall brightness.<br>

?> `RGB_*` keycodes cannot be used with functions like `tap_code16(RGB_HUI)` as they're not USB HID keycodes. If you wish to replicate similar behaviour in custom code within your firmware (e.g. inside `encoder_update_user()` or `process_record_user()`), the equivalent [RGB functions](#functions) should be used instead.


!> By default, if you have both the RGB Light and the [RGB Matrix](feature_rgb_matrix.md) feature enabled, these keycodes will work for both features, at the same time. You can disable the keycode functionality by defining the `*_DISABLE_KEYCODES` option for the specific feature.

## Configuration

Your RGB lighting can be configured by placing these `#define`s in your `config.h`:

Note: For versions older than 0.6.117, The mode numbers were written directly. In `quantum/rgblight/rgblight.h` there is a contrast table between the old mode number and the current symbol.


### Effect and Animation Toggles

Use these defines to add or remove animations from the firmware. When you are running low on flash space, it can be helpful to disable animations you are not using.

|Define                              |Default      |Description                                                              |

!> `RGBLIGHT_ANIMATIONS` is being deprecated and animation modes should be explicitly defined.

### Effect and Animation Settings

The following options are used to tweak the various animations:

|Define                              |Default      |Description                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_BREATHE_CENTER`    |*Not defined*|If defined, used to calculate the curve for the breathing animation. Valid values are 1.0 to 2.7 |
|`RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_BREATHE_MAX`       |`255`        |The maximum brightness for the breathing mode. Valid values are 1 to 255                       |

### Example Usage to Reduce Memory Footprint
  1. Use `#undef` to selectively disable animations. The following would disable two animations and save about 4KiB:

```diff
 #undef RGBLED_NUM
+#undef RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_STATIC_GRADIENT
+#undef RGBLIGHT_EFFECT_RAINBOW_SWIRL
 #define RGBLED_NUM 12
 #define RGBLIGHT_HUE_STEP 8
 #define RGBLIGHT_SAT_STEP 8
```

### Animation Speed

You can also modify the speeds that the different modes animate at:

Here is a quick demo on Youtube (with NPKC KC60) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKrpPAHlisY).

```c
// How long (in milliseconds) to wait between animation steps for each of the "Solid color breathing" animations
const uint8_t RGBLED_BREATHING_INTERVALS[] PROGMEM = {30, 20, 10, 5};

// How long (in milliseconds) to wait between animation steps for each of the "Cycling rainbow" animations
const uint8_t RGBLED_RAINBOW_MOOD_INTERVALS[] PROGMEM = {120, 60, 30};

// How long (in milliseconds) to wait between animation steps for each of the "Swirling rainbow" animations
const uint8_t RGBLED_RAINBOW_SWIRL_INTERVALS[] PROGMEM = {100, 50, 20};

// How long (in milliseconds) to wait between animation steps for each of the "Snake" animations
const uint8_t RGBLED_SNAKE_INTERVALS[] PROGMEM = {100, 50, 20};

// How long (in milliseconds) to wait between animation steps for each of the "Knight" animations
const uint8_t RGBLED_KNIGHT_INTERVALS[] PROGMEM = {127, 63, 31};

// How long (in milliseconds) to wait between animation steps for each of the "Twinkle" animations
const uint8_t RGBLED_TWINKLE_INTERVALS[] PROGMEM = {50, 25, 10};

// These control which hues are selected for each of the "Static gradient" modes
const uint8_t RGBLED_GRADIENT_RANGES[] PROGMEM = {255, 170, 127, 85, 64};
```

## Lighting Layers

?> **Note:** Lighting Layers is an RGB Light feature, it will not work for RGB Matrix. See [RGB Matrix Indicators](feature_rgb_matrix.md#indicators) for details on how to do so.

By including `#define RGBLIGHT_LAYERS` in your `config.h` file you can enable lighting layers. These make
it easy to use your underglow LEDs as status indicators to show which keyboard layer is currently active, or the state of caps lock, all without disrupting any animations. [Here's a video](https://youtu.be/uLGE1epbmdY) showing an example of what you can do.

### Defining Lighting Layers :id=defining-lighting-layers

By default, 8 layers are possible. This can be expanded to as many as 32 by overriding the definition of `RGBLIGHT_MAX_LAYERS` in `config.h` (e.g. `#define RGBLIGHT_MAX_LAYERS 32`). Please note, if you use a split keyboard, you will need to flash both sides of the split after changing this. Also, increasing the maximum will increase the firmware size, and will slow sync on split keyboards.

To define a layer, we modify `keymap.c` to list the LED ranges and the colors we want to overlay on them using an array of `rgblight_segment_t` using the `RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS` macro. We can define multiple layers and enable/disable them independently:

```c
// Light LEDs 6 to 9 and 12 to 15 red when caps lock is active. Hard to ignore!
const rgblight_segment_t PROGMEM my_capslock_layer[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS(
    {6, 4, HSV_RED},       // Light 4 LEDs, starting with LED 6
    {12, 4, HSV_RED}       // Light 4 LEDs, starting with LED 12
);
// Light LEDs 9 & 10 in cyan when keyboard layer 1 is active
const rgblight_segment_t PROGMEM my_layer1_layer[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS(
    {9, 2, HSV_CYAN}
);
// Light LEDs 11 & 12 in purple when keyboard layer 2 is active
const rgblight_segment_t PROGMEM my_layer2_layer[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS(
    {11, 2, HSV_PURPLE}
);
// Light LEDs 13 & 14 in green when keyboard layer 3 is active
const rgblight_segment_t PROGMEM my_layer3_layer[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS(
    {13, 2, HSV_GREEN}
);
// etc..
```

We combine these layers into an array using the `RGBLIGHT_LAYERS_LIST` macro, and assign it to the `rgblight_layers` variable during keyboard setup. Note that you can only define up to 8 lighting layers. Any extra layers will be ignored. Since the different lighting layers overlap, the order matters in the array, with later layers taking precedence:

```c
// Now define the array of layers. Later layers take precedence
const rgblight_segment_t* const PROGMEM my_rgb_layers[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYERS_LIST(
    my_capslock_layer,
    my_layer1_layer,    // Overrides caps lock layer
    my_layer2_layer,    // Overrides other layers
    my_layer3_layer     // Overrides other layers
);

void keyboard_post_init_user(void) {
    // Enable the LED layers
    rgblight_layers = my_rgb_layers;
}
```
Note: For split keyboards with two controllers, both sides need to be flashed when updating the contents of rgblight_layers.

### Enabling and disabling lighting layers :id=enabling-lighting-layers

Everything above just configured the definition of each lighting layer.
We can now enable and disable the lighting layers whenever the state of the keyboard changes:

```c
bool led_update_user(led_t led_state) {
    rgblight_set_layer_state(0, led_state.caps_lock);
    return true;
}

layer_state_t default_layer_state_set_user(layer_state_t state) {
    rgblight_set_layer_state(1, layer_state_cmp(state, _DVORAK));
    return state;
}

layer_state_t layer_state_set_user(layer_state_t state) {
    rgblight_set_layer_state(2, layer_state_cmp(state, _FN));
    rgblight_set_layer_state(3, layer_state_cmp(state, _ADJUST));
    return state;
}
```

### Lighting layer blink :id=lighting-layer-blink

By including `#define RGBLIGHT_LAYER_BLINK` in your `config.h` file you can turn a lighting
layer on for a specified duration. Once the specified number of milliseconds has elapsed
the layer will be turned off. This is useful, e.g., if you want to acknowledge some
action (e.g. toggling some setting):

```c
const rgblight_segment_t PROGMEM _yes_layer[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS( {9, 6, HSV_GREEN} );
const rgblight_segment_t PROGMEM _no_layer[] = RGBLIGHT_LAYER_SEGMENTS( {9, 6, HSV_RED} );

const rgblight_segment_t* const PROGMEM _rgb_layers[] =
    RGBLIGHT_LAYERS_LIST( _yes_layer, _no_layer );

void keyboard_post_init_user(void) {
    rgblight_layers = _rgb_layers;
}

// Note we user post_process_record_user because we want the state
// after the flag has been flipped...
void post_process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
    switch (keycode) {
        case QK_DEBUG_TOGGLE:
            rgblight_blink_layer(debug_enable ? 0 : 1, 500);
            break;

        case NK_TOGG:
        case NK_ON:
        case NK_OFF:
            rgblight_blink_layer(keymap_config.nkro ? 0 : 1, 500);
            break;
    }
}
```

You can also use `rgblight_blink_layer_repeat` to specify the amount of times the layer is supposed to blink. Using the layers from above,
```c
void post_process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
    switch (keycode) {
        case QK_DEBUG_TOGGLE:
            rgblight_blink_layer_repeat(debug_enable ? 0 : 1, 200, 3);
            break;
    }
}
```
would turn the layer 0 (or 1) on and off again three times when `DB_TOGG` is pressed.

Blinking accumulates layers so if multiple layers are set blinking at the same time they will all blink for the duration and repeat times of the last layer to be blinked.
To stop these other layers from blinking use `rgblight_unblink_layer` or `rgblight_unblink_all_but_layer`:

```c
rgblight_blink_layer(1, 500);
rgblight_unblink_all_but_layer(1);
```

```c
rgblight_unblink_layer(3);
rgblight_blink_layer(2, 500);
```

!> Lighting layers on split keyboards will require layer state synced to the slave half (e.g. `#define SPLIT_LAYER_STATE_ENABLE`). See [data sync options](feature_split_keyboard.md#data-sync-options) for more details.

### Overriding RGB Lighting on/off status

Normally lighting layers are not shown when RGB Lighting is disabled (e.g. with `RGB_TOG` keycode). If you would like lighting layers to work even when the RGB Lighting is otherwise off, add `#define RGBLIGHT_LAYERS_OVERRIDE_RGB_OFF` to your `config.h`.

### Retain brightness

Usually lighting layers apply their configured brightness once activated. If you would like lighting layers to retain the currently used brightness (as returned by `rgblight_get_val()`), add `#define RGBLIGHT_LAYERS_RETAIN_VAL` to your `config.h`.

## Functions

If you need to change your RGB lighting in code, for example in a macro to change the color whenever you switch layers, QMK provides a set of functions to assist you. See [`rgblight.h`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/quantum/rgblight/rgblight.h) for the full list, but the most commonly used functions include:

```

These are defined in [`color.h`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/quantum/color.h). Feel free to add to this list!


## Changing the order of the LEDs

If you want to make the logical order of LEDs different from the electrical connection order, you can do this by defining the `RGBLIGHT_LED_MAP` macro in your `config.h`.

Normally, the contents of the LED buffer are output to the LEDs in the same order.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2170248/55743718-01866c80-5a6e-11e9-8134-25419928327a.JPG" alt="simple dicrect" width="50%"/>

By defining `RGBLIGHT_LED_MAP` as in the example below, you can specify the LED with addressing in reverse order of the electrical connection order.

```c
// config.h

#define RGBLED_NUM 4
#define RGBLIGHT_LED_MAP { 3, 2, 1, 0 }

```
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2170248/55743725-08ad7a80-5a6e-11e9-83ed-126a2b0209fc.JPG" alt="simple mapped" width="50%"/>

```
## Clipping Range

Using the `rgblight_set_clipping_range()` function, you can prepare more buffers than the actual number of LEDs, and output some of the buffers to the LEDs. This is useful if you want the split keyboard to treat left and right LEDs as logically contiguous.

You can set the Clipping Range by executing the following code.

```c
// some source
rgblight_set_clipping_range(3, 4);
```
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2170248/55743785-2bd82a00-5a6e-11e9-9d4b-1b4ffaf4932b.JPG" alt="clip direct" width="70%"/>

In addition to setting the Clipping Range, you can use `RGBLIGHT_LED_MAP` together.

```c
// config.h
#define RGBLED_NUM 8
#define RGBLIGHT_LED_MAP { 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 }

// some soruce
  rgblight_set_clipping_range(3, 4);
```
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2170248/55743747-119e4c00-5a6e-11e9-91e5-013203ffae8a.JPG" alt="clip mapped" width="70%"/>

## Hardware Modification

If your keyboard lacks onboard underglow LEDs, you may often be able to solder on an RGB LED strip yourself. You will need to find an unused pin to wire to the data pin of your LED strip. Some keyboards may break out unused pins from the MCU to make soldering easier. The other two pins, VCC and GND, must also be connected to the appropriate power pins.

# Pointing Device :id=pointing-device

Pointing Device is a generic name for a feature intended to be generic: moving the system pointer around.  There are certainly other options for it - like mousekeys - but this aims to be easily modifiable and hardware driven.  You can implement custom keys to control functionality, or you can gather information from other peripherals and insert it directly here - let QMK handle the processing for you.

To enable Pointing Device, uncomment the following line in your rules.mk:

```make
POINTING_DEVICE_ENABLE = yes
```

## Sensor Drivers

There are a number of sensors that are supported by default. Note that only one sensor can be enabled by `POINTING_DEVICE_DRIVER` at a time.  If you need to enable more than one sensor, then you need to implement it manually.

### ADNS 5050 Sensor

To use the ADNS 5050 sensor, add this to your `rules.mk`

```make
POINTING_DEVICE_DRIVER = adns5050
```

The ADNS 5050 sensor uses a serial type protocol for communication, and requires an additional light source. 

| Setting            | Description                                                         |

### Custom Driver

If you have a sensor type that isn't supported here, you can manually implement it, by adding these functions (with the correct implementation for your device):

```c
void           pointing_device_driver_init(void) {}
report_mouse_t pointing_device_driver_get_report(report_mouse_t mouse_report) { return mouse_report; }
uint16_t       pointing_device_driver_get_cpi(void) { return 0; }
void           pointing_device_driver_set_cpi(uint16_t cpi) {}
```

!> Ideally, new sensor hardware should be added to `drivers/sensors/` and `quantum/pointing_device_drivers.c`, but there may be cases where it's very specific to the hardware.  So these functions are provided, just in case.

# Manipulating Mouse Reports

The report_mouse_t (here "mouseReport") has the following properties:

* `mouseReport.x` - this is a signed int from -127 to 127 (not 128, this is defined in USB HID spec) representing movement (+ to the right, - to the left) on the x axis.
* `mouseReport.y` - this is a signed int from -127 to 127 (not 128, this is defined in USB HID spec) representing movement (+ upward, - downward) on the y axis.
* `mouseReport.v` - this is a signed int from -127 to 127 (not 128, this is defined in USB HID spec) representing vertical scrolling (+ upward, - downward).
* `mouseReport.h` - this is a signed int from -127 to 127 (not 128, this is defined in USB HID spec) representing horizontal scrolling (+ right, - left).
* `mouseReport.buttons` - this is a uint8_t in which all 8 bits are used.  These bits represent the mouse button state - bit 0 is mouse button 1, and bit 7 is mouse button 8.

To manually manipulate the mouse reports outside of the `pointing_device_task_*` functions, you can use:

* `pointing_device_get_report()` - Returns the current report_mouse_t that represents the information sent to the host computer
* `pointing_device_set_report(report_mouse_t newMouseReport)` - Overrides and saves the report_mouse_t to be sent to the host computer
* `pointing_device_send()` - Sends the mouse report to the host and zeroes out the report. 

When the mouse report is sent, the x, y, v, and h values are set to 0 (this is done in `pointing_device_send()`, which can be overridden to avoid this behavior).  This way, button states persist, but movement will only occur once.  For further customization, both `pointing_device_init` and `pointing_device_task` can be overridden.

Additionally, by default, `pointing_device_send()` will only send a report when the report has actually changed.  This prevents it from continuously sending mouse reports, which will keep the host system awake.  This behavior can be changed by creating your own `pointing_device_send()` function.

Also, you use the `has_mouse_report_changed(new, old)` function to check to see if the report has changed.

## Examples

### Custom Mouse Keycode

In this example, a custom key is used to click the mouse and scroll 127 units vertically and horizontally, then undo all of that when released - because that's a totally useful function.

```c
case MS_SPECIAL:
    report_mouse_t currentReport = pointing_device_get_report();
    if (record->event.pressed) {
        currentReport.v = 127;
        currentReport.h = 127;
        currentReport.buttons |= MOUSE_BTN1;  // this is defined in report.h
    } else {
        currentReport.v = -127;
        currentReport.h = -127;
        currentReport.buttons &= ~MOUSE_BTN1;
    }
    pointing_device_set_report(currentReport);
    pointing_device_send();
    break;
```

Recall that the mouse report is set to zero (except the buttons) whenever it is sent, so the scrolling would only occur once in each case.

### Drag Scroll or Mouse Scroll

A very common implementation is to use the mouse movement to scroll instead of moving the cursor on the system.  This uses the `pointing_device_task_user` callback to intercept and modify the mouse report before it's sent to the host system. 

```c
enum custom_keycodes {
    DRAG_SCROLL = SAFE_RANGE,
};

bool set_scrolling = false;

report_mouse_t pointing_device_task_user(report_mouse_t mouse_report) {
    if (set_scrolling) {
        mouse_report.h = mouse_report.x;
        mouse_report.v = mouse_report.y;
        mouse_report.x = mouse_report.y = 0
    }
    return mouse_report;
}

bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
    if (keycode == DRAG_SCROLL && record->event.pressed) {
        set_scrolling = !set_scrolling;
    }
    return true;
}
```

This allows you to toggle between scrolling and cursor movement by pressing the DRAG_SCROLL key.

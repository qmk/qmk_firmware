## What is QMK Firmware?

QMK (*Quantum Mechanical Keyboard*) is an open source community centered around developing computer input devices. The community encompasses all sorts of input devices, such as keyboards, mice, and MIDI devices. A core group of collaborators maintains [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware), [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm), [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox), [qmk.fm](https://qmk.fm), and this documentation with the help of community members like you.

## Get Started

Totally new to QMK? There are two ways to get started:

* Basic: [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm)
    * Just select your keyboard from the dropdown and program your keyboard.
    * We have an [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-imgglzDMdY) you can watch.
    * There is also an overview [document you can read](newbs_building_firmware_configurator.md).
* Advanced: [Use The Source](newbs.md)
    * More powerful, but harder to use

## Make It Yours

QMK has lots of features to explore, and a good deal of reference documentation to dig through. Most features are taken advantage of by modifying your [keymap](keymap.md), and changing the [keycodes](keycodes.md).

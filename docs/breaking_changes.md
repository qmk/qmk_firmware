# Breaking Changes

This document describes QMK's Breaking Change process. A Breaking Change is any change which modifies how QMK behaves in a way that in incompatible or potentially dangerous. We limit these changes so that users can have confidence that updating their QMK tree will not break their keymaps.

This also includes any keyboard moves within the repository.

The breaking change period is when we will merge PR's that change QMK in dangerous or unexpected ways. There is a built-in period of testing so we are confident that any problems caused are rare or unable to be predicted.

## When is the next Breaking Change?

The next Breaking Change is scheduled for February 26, 2022.

### Important Dates

* [x] 2021 Nov 27 - `develop` is tagged with a new release version. Each push to `master` is subsequently merged to `develop` by GitHub actions.
* [ ] 2022 Jan 31 - `develop` closed to new PR's.
* [ ] 2022 Jan 31 - Call for testers.
* [ ] 2022 Feb 12 - Last day for merges -- after this point `develop` is locked for testing and accepts only bugfixes
* [ ] 2022 Feb 24 - `master` is locked, no PR's merged.
* [ ] 2022 Feb 26 - Merge `develop` to `master`.
* [ ] 2022 Feb 26 - `master` is unlocked. PR's can be merged again.

## What changes will be included?

To see a list of breaking change candidates you can look at the [`breaking_change` label](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abreaking_change+is%3Apr). New changes might be added between now and when `develop` is closed, and a PR with that label applied is not guaranteed to be merged.

If you want your breaking change to be included in this round you need to create a PR with the `breaking_change` label and have it accepted before `develop` closes. After `develop` closes no new breaking changes will be accepted.

Criteria for acceptance:

* The PR is complete and ready to merge
* The PR has a ChangeLog file describing the changes under `<qmk_firmware>/docs/Changelog/20220226`.
    * This should be in Markdown format, with a name in the format `PR12345.md`, substituting the digits for your PR's ID.
    * One strong recommendation that the ChangeLog document matches the PR description on GitHub, so as to ensure traceability.

# Checklists

This section documents various processes we use when running the Breaking Changes process.

## Creating the `develop` branch

This happens immediately after the previous `develop` branch is merged.

* `qmk_firmware` git commands
    * [ ] `git checkout master`
    * [ ] `git pull --ff-only`
    * [ ] `git checkout -b develop`
    * [ ] Edit `readme.md`
        * [ ] Add a big notice at the top that this is a testing branch.
        * [ ] Include a link to this document
    * [ ] `git commit -m 'Branch point for <DATE> Breaking Change'`
    * [ ] `git tag breakpoint_<YYYY>_<MM>_<DD>`
    * [ ] `git tag <next_version>` # Prevent the breakpoint tag from confusing version incrementing
    * [ ] `git push upstream develop`
    * [ ] `git push --tags`

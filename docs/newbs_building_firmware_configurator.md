The [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm) is an online graphical user interface that generates QMK Firmware hex files.

Watch the [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-imgglzDMdY). Many people find that is enough information to start programming their own keyboard.

The QMK Configurator works best with Chrome or Firefox.

!> **Note: Files from other tools such as KLE, or kbfirmware will not be compatible with QMK Configurator. Do not load them, do not import them. QMK Configurator is a DIFFERENT tool.**

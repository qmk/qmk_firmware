# QMK Breaking Changes - 2023 May 28 Changelog

## Notable Changes {#notable-changes}

As per last breaking changes cycle, there has been _a lot_ of emphasis on behind-the-scenes changes, mainly around migration of configurables into `info.json` files, cleanup of `info.json` files, additional layout definitions for keyboards, adding support for general community layouts to keyboards, as well as addressing technical debt.

Of note for keyboard designers:

* Layout and matrix definitions in `info.json` are now _mandatory_ for merge into QMK.
    * Layout macros in `<yourkeyboard>.h` are no longer accepted into QMK Firmware.
    * Existing keyboards have been meticulously converted by the QMK collaborators
    * Layouts missing from keyboard definitions have been added in the process
    * Keys within layouts should not specify `"w":1` or `"h":1` if the key size is 1 -- `w`/`h` should only be present for sizes other than 1
* `config_common.h` has been removed and should not be present anywhere in your keyboard code.
* `RGB_DI_PIN` will now cause an error during build:
    * For WS2812-like LEDs, this should be moved to `info.json`: `"ws2812": { "pin": "xxx" }`
    * For APA102 LEDs, this should be moved to `info.json`: `"apa102": { "data_pin": "xxx" }`
* Other mandatory data-driven changes should be automatically flagged during build
* Keymaps with `encoder_map` should now have the following change made:
    * `encoder_map[][NUM_ENCODERS][2]` => `encoder_map[][NUM_ENCODERS][NUM_DIRECTIONS]`
    * Users assumed the `2` referred to the number of encoders, rather than the number of directions (which is always 2)

### Repeat last key ([#19700](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/19700)) {#repeat-last-key}

A new pair of keys has been added to QMK -- namely `QK_REPEAT_KEY` and `QK_ALT_REPEAT_KEY` (shortened: `QK_REP`/`QK_AREP`). These allow you to repeat the last key pressed, or in the case of the alternate key, press the "opposite" of the last key. For example, if you press `KC_LEFT`, pressing `QK_REPEAT_KEY` afterwards repeats `KC_LEFT`, but pressing `QK_ALT_REPEAT_KEY` instead sends `KC_RIGHT`.

The full list of default alternate keys is available on the [Repeat Key](../feature_repeat_key) documentation.

To enable these keys, in your keymap's `rules.mk`, add:

```make
REPEAT_KEY_ENABLE = yes
```

...and add them to your keymap.

### User callback for pre process record ([#20584](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/20584)) {#user-callback-for-pre-process-record}

Two new boolean callback functions, `pre_process_record_kb` and `pre_process_record_user`, have been added. They are called at the beginning of `process_record`, right before `process_combo`.

Similar to existing `*_kb` and `*_user` callback functions, returning `false` will halt further processing of key events. The `pre_process_record_user` function will allow user space opportunity to handle or capture an input before it undergoes quantum processing. For example, while action tapping is still resolving the tap or hold output of a mod-tap key, `pre_process_record_user` can capture the next key record of an input event that follows. That key record can be used to influence the [decision of the mod-tap](../tap_hold) key that is currently undergoing quantum processing.

### Consolidate modelm ([#14996](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/14996) {#consolidate-modelm}

Several build targets for the IBM Model M were cluttered in different folders. The maintainers of several Model M replacement controller projects agreed to consolidate them under one common folder.

The list of all moved keyboard locations is listed [below](20230528#updated-keyboard-codebases).

## Changes Requiring User Action {#changes-requiring-user-action}

### `IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT` behaviour changes ([#20211](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/20211)) {#i-m-t-i}

Following up from the last breaking changes cycle, `IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT` has been removed and if present in keymap code, will now fail to build. The previous functionality for `IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT` is now default, and should you wish to revert to the old behaviour, you can use `HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS` instead.

For more information, you are invited to read the section on [HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS](../tap_hold#hold-on-other-key-press) in the page on [Tap-Hold configuration options](../tap_hold).

## Notable core changes {#notable-core}

### Encoder functionality fallback ([#20320](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/20320)) {#encoder-functionality-fallback}

For keyboards who have not yet been migrated to encoder map, a default set of encoder functionality is now enabled, gracefully degrading functionality depending on which flags are enabled by the keyboard:

* If `EXTRAKEY_ENABLE` is enabled by the keyboard, the encoder will be mapped to `KC_VOLU`/`KC_VOLD`
* If `MOUSEKEY_ENABLE` is enabled by the keyboard, the encoder will be mapped to `KC_MS_WH_UP`/`KC_MS_WH_DOWN`
* Otherwise, `KC_PGDN`/`KC_PGUP` will be used

Additionally, this ensures that builds on QMK Configurator produce some sort of usable encoder mapping.

### OLED Driver Improvements ([#20331](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/20331)) {#oled-driver-improvements}

The "classic" OLED driver picked up support for additional sizes of OLED displays, support for the SH1107 controller, and SPI-based OLED support.

Other configurable items are available and can be found on the [OLED Driver page](../feature_oled_driver).

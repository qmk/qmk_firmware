# Tap dance state removed from `tap_dance_action_t`

Code that accessed the tap dance state as a field in the tap dance action should now call `tap_dance_get_state(int tap_dance_idx)` instead. That function may return `NULL` if many tap dance keys are held together. Add a `NULL` check before using the returned state.

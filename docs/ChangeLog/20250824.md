# QMK Breaking Changes - 2025 August 24 Changelog

## Notable Features

### Tap Dance ([#25415](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/25415))

Tap dance state has been removed from `tap_dance_action_t`. Instead, tap dance
state can now be obtained from a method `tap_dance_get_state(int tap_dance_idx)`.

`action.state->xxxxx` should generally be replaced with:

```c
tap_dance_state_t* state;
...
state = tap_dance_get_state(QK_TAP_DANCE_GET_INDEX(keycode));
...
state->xxxxx
```
   
Eg. [Example 3 in the tap dance documentation](../tap_dance#example-3).

Tap dance functions that obtain the state as a parameter to one of the callback
methods are unaffected. They will continue to work without changes.

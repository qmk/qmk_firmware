## Debounce: Deprecate init and remove num_rows parameter [#25632](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/25632)

With dynamic memory allocation removed from all debounce implementations ([#25515](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/25515)), the `num_rows` parameter has been removed from the `debounce_init()` and `debounce()` functions. The `MATRIX_ROWS_PER_HAND` is now used by default in every implementation.

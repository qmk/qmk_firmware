# Refactor debounce algorithm with static allocation [#25515](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/25515)

Removed dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free) from all debounce implementations for improved efficiency on embedded systems and to avoid runtime allocation overhead. Refactored state arrays to use direct indexing, simplifying code and eliminating pointer arithmetic. Standardized usage of MATRIX_ROWS_PER_HAND throughout the codebase to ensure consistent support for split keyboards.

# PR checklists

This is a non-exhaustive checklist of what the QMK Collaborators will be checking when reviewing submitted PRs.

If there are any inconsistencies with these recommendations, you're best off [creating an issue](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/new) against this document, or getting in touch with a QMK Collaborator on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Uq7gcHh).

## General PRs

- PR should be submitted using a non-`master` branch on the source repository
    - this does not mean you target a different branch for your PR, rather that you're not working out of your own master branch
    - if submitter _does_ use their own `master` branch, they'll be given a link to the ["how to git"](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_git_using_your_master_branch) page after merging -- (end of this document will contain the contents of the message)
- newly-added directories and filenames must be lowercase
    - this rule may be relaxed if upstream sources originally had uppercase characters (e.g. ChibiOS, or imported files from other repositories etc.)
    - if there is enough justification (i.e. consistency with existing core files etc.) this can be relaxed
        - a board designer naming their keyboard with uppercase letters is not enough justification
- valid license headers on all `*.c` and `*.h` source files
    - GPL2/GPL3 recommended for consistency
    - other licenses are permitted, however they must be GPL-compatible and must allow for redistribution. Using a different license will almost certainly delay a PR getting merged.
- QMK Codebase "best practices" followed
    - this is not an exhaustive list, and will likely get amended as time goes by
    - `#pragma once` instead of `#ifndef` include guards in header files
    - no "old-school" GPIO/I2C/SPI functions used -- must use QMK abstractions unless justifiable (and laziness is not valid justification)
    - timing abstractions should be followed too:
        - `wait_ms()` instead of `_delay_ms()` (remove `#include <util/delay.h>` too)
        - `timer_read()` and `timer_read32()` etc. -- see [timer.h](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/tmk_core/common/timer.h) for the timing APIs
    - if you think a new abstraction is useful, you're encouraged to:
        - prototype it in your own keyboard until it's feature-complete
        - discuss it with QMK Collaborators on Discord
        - refactor it as a separate core change
        - remove your specific copy in your board
- rebase and fix all merge conflicts before opening the PR (in case you need help or advice, reach out to QMK Collaborators on Discord)

## Keymap PRs

- `#include QMK_KEYBOARD_H` preferred to including specific board files
- prefer layer `enum`s to `#define`s
- require custom keycode `enum`s to `#define`s, first entry must have ` = SAFE_RANGE`
- terminating backslash (`\`) in lines of LAYOUT macro parameters is superfluous
- some care with spacing (e.g., alignment on commas or first char of keycodes) makes for a much nicer-looking keymap

## Keyboard PRs

Closed PRs (for inspiration, previous sets of review comments will help you eliminate ping-pong of your own reviews):
https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Akeyboard

- `info.json`
    - valid URL
    - valid maintainer
    - displays correctly in Configurator (press Ctrl+Shift+I to preview local file, turn on fast input to verify ordering)
- `readme.md`
    - standard template should be present
    - flash command has `:flash` at end
    - valid hardware availability link (unless handwired) -- private groupbuys are okay, but one-off prototypes will be questioned. If open-source, a link to files should be provided.
    - clear instructions on how to reset the board into bootloader mode
    - a picture about the keyboard and preferably about the PCB, too
- `rules.mk`
    - removed `MIDI_ENABLE`, `FAUXCLICKY_ENABLE` and `HD44780_ENABLE`
    - modified `# Enable Bluetooth with the Adafruit EZ-Key HID` -> `# Enable Bluetooth`
    - no `(-/+size)` comments related to enabling features
    - remove the list of alternate bootloaders if one has been specified
    - no re-definitions of the default MCU parameters if same value, when compared to the equivalent MCU in [mcu_selection.mk](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/quantum/mcu_selection.mk)
- keyboard `config.h`
    - don't repeat `MANUFACTURER` in the `PRODUCT` value
    - no `#define DESCRIPTION`
    - no Magic Key Options, MIDI Options or HD44780 configuration
    - user preference configurable `#define`s need to be moved to keymap `config.h`
    - "`DEBOUNCE`" instead of "`DEBOUNCING_DELAY`"
    - bare minimum required code for a board to boot into QMK should be present
        - initialisation code for the matrix and critical devices
        - mirroring existing functionality of a commercial board (like custom keycodes and special animations etc.) should be handled through non-`default` keymaps
- `keyboard.c`
    - empty `xxxx_xxxx_kb()` or other weak-defined default implemented functions removed
    - commented-out functions removed too
    - `matrix_init_board()` etc. migrated to `keyboard_pre_init_kb()`, see: [keyboard_pre_init*](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/custom_quantum_functions?id=keyboard_pre_init_-function-documentation)
    - prefer `CUSTOM_MATRIX = lite` if custom matrix used, allows for standard debounce, see [custom matrix 'lite'](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/custom_matrix?id=lite)
    - prefer LED indicator [Configuration Options](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_led_indicators?id=configuration-options) to custom `led_update_*()` implementations where possible
- `keyboard.h`
    - `#include "quantum.h"` appears at the top
    - `LAYOUT` macros should use standard definitions if applicable
        - use the Community Layout macro names where they apply (preferred above `LAYOUT`/`LAYOUT_all`)
- keymap `config.h`
    - no duplication of `rules.mk` or `config.h` from keyboard
- `keymaps/default/keymap.c`
    - `QMKBEST`/`QMKURL` removed (sheesh)
    - if using `MO(_LOWER)` and `MO(_RAISE)` keycodes or equivalent, and the keymap has an adjust layer when holding both keys -- if the keymap has no "direct-to-adjust" keycode (such as `MO(_ADJUST)`) then you should prefer to write...
        ```
        layer_state_t layer_state_set_user(layer_state_t state) {
          return update_tri_layer_state(state, _LOWER, _RAISE, _ADJUST);
        }
        ```
        ...instead of manually handling `layer_on()`, `update_tri_layer()` inside the keymap's `process_record_user()`.
- default (and via) keymaps should be "pristine"
    - bare minimum to be used as a "clean slate" for another user to develop their own user-specific keymap
    - standard layouts preferred in these keymaps, if possible
- submitters can have a personal (or bells-and-whistles) keymap showcasing capabilities in the same PR but it shouldn't be embedded in the 'default' keymap
- submitters can also have a "manufacturer-matching" keymap that mirrors existing functionality of the commercial product, if porting an existing board

Also, specific to ChibiOS:
- **strong** preference to using existing ChibiOS board definitions.
    - a lot of the time, an equivalent Nucleo board can be used with a different flash size or slightly different model in the same family
        - example: For an STM32L082KZ, given the similarity to an STM32L073RZ, you can use `BOARD = ST_NUCLEO64_L073RZ` in rules.mk
    - QMK is migrating to not having custom board definitions if at all possible, due to the ongoing maintenance burden when upgrading ChibiOS
- if a board definition is unavoidable, `board.c` must have a standard `__early_init()` (as per normal ChibiOS board defs) and an empty `boardInit()`:
    - see Arm/ChibiOS [early initialization](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/platformdev_chibios_earlyinit?id=board-init)
    - `__early_init()` should be replaced by either `early_hardware_init_pre()` or `early_hardware_init_post()` as appropriate
    - `boardInit()` should be migrated to `board_init()`

## Core PRs

- must now target `develop` branch, which will subsequently be merged back to `master` on the breaking changes timeline
- other notes TBD
    - core is a lot more subjective given the breadth of posted changes

---

## Notes

For when people use their own `master` branch, post this after merge:
```
For future reference, we recommend against committing to your `master` branch as you've done here, because pull requests from modified `master` branches can make it more difficult to keep your QMK fork updated. It is highly recommended for QMK development – regardless of what is being done or where – to keep your master updated, but **NEVER** commit to it. Instead, do all your changes in a branch (branches are basically free in Git) and issue PRs from your branches when you're developing.

There are instructions on how to keep your fork updated here:

[**Best Practices: Your Fork's Master: Update Often, Commit Never**](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_git_using_your_master_branch)

[Fixing Your Branch](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_git_resynchronize_a_branch) will walk you through fixing up your `master` branch moving forward. If you need any help with this just ask.

Thanks for contributing!

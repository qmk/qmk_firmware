 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Firmware for a Teensy2++ AVR-based miniboard to control four relays, using the
 *  same protocol used by the commercially available Silver Shield PM power outlets
 *  ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/sispmctl ) sold for some time. Because this
 *  project mimics the original device, it can be controlled using the "sismpctl"
 *  package included in many Linux distributions - including router-orientated
 *  versions such as OpenWRT - to control the board's relays.
 *
 *  Relays 1 to 4 are respectively wired to pins C4, C5, C6 and C7 of the Teensy++ V2,
 *  which are the PORTC bits 4 to 7 of the AT90USB1286. The relays MUST be wired through
 *  a transistor, and a diode must be added on the relay's contact pins to protect
 *  the transistor from back EMF generated from the relay when the coil is turned off.
 *  The transistor base pin is wired to the Teensy data port through a 10K resistor. A
 *  LED may be also be added as a relay status indicator on each channel.
 *
 *  The Relay coil will be driven by the transistor, but the power will come from
 *  the 5V from the PC's USB port: Be careful in choosing the relay to avoid overloading
 *  the PC, as the maximum current used MUST remains under ~450mA @ 5V.
 *
 *  The author's tested relays are 2 Finder 32.21.7.005.2000, coil il 125ohm, which can
 *  handle 5A @ 250VAC. Be careful to use proper isolation if high voltages are manipulated.
 *  The author used Hotglue to isolate all parts of the PCB in contact with high voltage.

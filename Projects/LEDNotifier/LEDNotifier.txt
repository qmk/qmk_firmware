 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  USB LED Notifier Project. This project is designed for the Busware BUI board, however it can run easily on any
 *  USB AVR. It is a generic RGB LED controller (via a three channel software PWM) which listens for commands from the
 *  host on a CDC virtual serial port. When new commands are received, it updates the board LEDs.
 *
 *  This can be controlled with any host application that can write to the virtual serial port, allowing it to become
 *  a visual notification system for any number of custom host applications, such as a new unread email notifier.
 *

 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Firmware for a USB AVR powered USB TTL magnetic stripe reader (using a card
 *  reader such as the Omron V3B-4K) by Denver Gingerich. This project is designed
 *  to be used with the open source Stripe Snoop project at http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/.
 * 
 *  See http://ossguy.com/ss_usb/ for the USB reader hardware project website,
 *  including construction and support details.
 * 
 *  To use, connect your magnetic card reader device to the USB AVR as follows (pin and port mapping may be adjusted
 *  from the project makefile):
 * 
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Signal:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>AVR Port:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Track 1 Data</td>

 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Track 1 Clock</td>
 *    <td>PORTC, Pin 2</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Track 2 Data</td>
 *    <td>PORTC, Pin 3</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Track 2 Clock</td>
 *    <td>PORTC, Pin 0</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Track 3 Data</td>
 *    <td>PORTC, Pin 5</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Track 3 Clock</td>
 *    <td>PORTC, Pin 6</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>Card Detect</td>
 *    <td>PORTC, Pin 4</td>
 *   </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  This project is based on the LUFA Keyboard demonstration application,
 *  written by Denver Gingerich.
 *
 *  This application uses a keyboard HID driver to communicate the data collected
 *  a TTL magnetic stripe reader to the connected computer. The raw bitstream
 *  obtained from the magnetic stripe reader is "typed" through the keyboard
 *  driver as 0's and 1's. After every card swipe, the demo will send a return key.
 *

 *    <td>Gives the maximum number of bits per track which can be buffered by the device for later transmission to a host.</td>

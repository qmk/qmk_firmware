 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Simple HTTP webserver project. This project combines the LUFA library with the uIP TCP/IP full network stack and FatFS
 *  library to create a RNDIS host capable of serving out HTTP webpages to multiple hosts simultaneously. This project
 *  demonstrates how the libraries can be combined into a robust network enabled application, with the addition of a RNDIS
 *  network device.
 *
 *  To use this project, plug the USB AVR into a computer, so that it enumerates as a standard Mass Storage device. Load
 *  HTML files onto the disk, so that they can be served out to clients -- the default file to serve should be called
 *  <i>index.htm</i>. Filenames must be in 8.3 format for them to be retrieved correctly by the webserver, and the total
 *  requested file path must be equal to or less than 50 characters.
 *
 *  When attached to a RNDIS class device, such as a USB (desktop) modem, the system will enumerate the device, set the
 *  appropriate parameters needed for connectivity and begin listening for new HTTP connections on port 80. The device IP,
 *  netmask and default gateway IP must be set to values appropriate for the RNDIS device being used for this project to 
 *  work, if the DHCP client is disabled (see \ref SSec_Options).
 *
 *  When properly configured, the webserver can be accessed from any HTTP webrowser by typing in the device's static or
 *  dynamically allocated IP address.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this project, which can control the project behaviour when defined, or changed in value.

 *    <td>ENABLE_DHCP=<i>x</i></td>
 *    <td>Makefile CDEFS</td>
 *    <td>When set to 1, this enables the DHCP client for dynamic IP allocation of the network settings from a DHCP server.
 *        To disable DHCP and use the fixed address settings set elsewhere, set this to zero (do not undefine it).</td>

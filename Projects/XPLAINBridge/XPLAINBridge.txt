 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  This project serves a dual purpose. When loaded into the USB AVR on the XPLAIN board, it will act as either a USB to Serial
 *  converter for the XPLAIN's hardware USART (at a speed of 9600 baud), or a PDI programmer for the XMEGA. This project replaces
 *  the firmware preloaded onto the XPLAIN's onboard AT90USB1287 microcontroller.
 *
 *  When inserted, the JTAG port's TDI pin is read. If the pin is left high, the device will enumerate as a regular COM port on
 *  the host, which can then be opened and data exchanged between the XMEGA and Host as if the XMEGA was connected directly to
 *  the host's serial port. If the pin is pulled low, the device will enumerate as an AVRISP-MKII to the host, so that the XMEGA
 *  can be reprogrammed by AVRStudio or other compatible software such as avrdude.
 *
 *  After running this project for the first time on a new computer, you will need to supply the .INF file located in this project
 *  project's directory as the device's driver when running under Windows. This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers,
 *  negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt CDC-ACM
 *  drivers.
 *
 *  This project relies on files from the LUFA AVRISP-MKII project.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options

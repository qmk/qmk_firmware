 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Firmware for a USB AVR powered programmer for Arduino boards using the official Arduino bootloader. This
 *  project acts like a regular USB to Serial bridge, except that asserting the DTR line will cause a pulse
 *  to appear on a given port pin, to control the target's /RESET pin.
 *
 *  This is primarily designed to fit the Benito board from www.dorkbotpdx.org, but will suit all USB AVRs.
 *
 *  After running this project for the first time on a new computer, you will need to supply the .INF file located
 *  in this project's directory as the device's driver when running under Windows. This will enable Windows to use
 *  its inbuilt CDC drivers, negating the need for custom drivers for the device. Other Operating Systems should
 *  automatically use their own inbuilt CDC-ACM drivers.
 *

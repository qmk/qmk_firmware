 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  Temperature Data Logger project. This project is a very basic USB data logger for the current temperature as reported by
 *  the board's temperature sensor, writing the temperature to a file stored on the board's Dataflash in a FAT filesystem
 *  each time a specified interval elapses. When inserted into a PC, the datalogger will appear as a standard USB Mass Storage
 *  device with a single text file, which contains the logged data. Files are named according to the current date when the
 *  logging commences.
 *
 *  A DS1307 or compatible RTC IC is designed to be attached to the AVR's TWI bus, for the management of timestamps on the
 *  sampled data. This project will not function correctly if the RTC chip is omitted unless the DUMMY_RTC compile time token
 *  is specified - see \ref SSec_Options.
 *
 *  Due to the host's need for exclusive access to the filesystem, the device will not log samples while connected to a host.
 *  For the logger to store data, the Dataflash must first be formatted by the host so that it contains a valid FAT filesystem.
 *
 *  This project uses the FatFS library from ELM Chan (http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html) and the .NET HID device library
 *  LibHIDNet (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libhidnet/).
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>DUMMY_RTC</td>
 *    <td>Makefile CDEFS</td>
 *    <td>When a DS1307 RTC chip is not fitted, this token can be defined to make the demo assume a 1/1/1 01:01:01 date/time
 *        stamp at all times, effectively transforming the project into a basic data logger with no specified sample times.</td>

/**
 * \defgroup clock Clock interface
 *
 * The clock interface is the interface between the \ref timer "timer library"
 * and the platform specific clock functionality. The clock
 * interface must be implemented for each platform that uses the \ref
 * timer "timer library".
 *
 * The clock interface does only one this: it measures time. The clock
 * interface provides a macro, CLOCK_SECOND, which corresponds to one
 * second of system time.

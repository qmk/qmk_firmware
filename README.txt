This package contains the complete LUFA library, demos, user-submitted projects
and bootloaders for use with compatible microcontroller models. To get started,
you will need to install the "Doxygen" documentation generation tool from
www.doxygen.org, and run "make doxygen" from the command line. From there, the
generated HTML documentation for the library itself will be avaliable in the
LUFA/Documentation/html/ directory. View this documentation in your chosen web
browser for further Getting Started information.

The documentation for the library itself (but not the documentation for the
individual demos, projects or bootloaders) is also available as a seperate
package from the project webpage for convenience if Doxygen cannot be installed.

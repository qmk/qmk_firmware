 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a HID Class device, allowing for device FLASH programming through
 *  the supplied command line software, which is a modified version of Paul's TeensyHID Command Line loader code
 *  from PJRC, used with permission. This bootloader is delibertely non-compatible with the properietary HalfKay
 *  bootloader GUI; only the command line interface software accompanying this bootloader will work with it.
 *  
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and will fit into 2KB of bootloader space for the
 *  Series 2 USB AVRs (ATMEGAxxU2, AT90USBxx2) or 4KB of bootloader space for all other models. If you wish to
 *  enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU values in the
 *  accompanying makefile.
 *

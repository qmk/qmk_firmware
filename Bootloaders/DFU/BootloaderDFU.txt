 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a DFU Class device, allowing for DFU-compatible programming
 *  software to load firmware onto the AVR.
 *  
 *  This bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP application. However, it requires the use of Atmel's
 *  DFU drivers. You will need to install Atmel's DFU drivers prior to using this bootloader.
 *  
 *  As an open-source option, this bootloader is also compatible with the Linux Atmel USB DFU Programmer
 *  software, available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dfu-programmer/.
 *  
 *  If SECURE_MODE is defined as true, upon start-up the bootloader will be locked, with only the chip erase
 *  function available (similar to Atmel's DFU bootloader). If SECURE_MODE is defined as false, all functions 
 *  are usable on start-up without the prerequisite firmware erase.
 *  
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and should fit into 4KB of bootloader space. If
 *  you wish to enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU
 *  values in the accompanying makefile.
 *  
 *  <b>NOTE:</b> This device spoofs Atmel's DFU Bootloader USB VID and PID so that the Atmel DFU bootloader
 *               drivers included with FLIP will work. If you do not wish to use Atmel's ID codes, please
 *               manually change them in Descriptors.c and alter your driver's INF file accordingly.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td><b>Define Name:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Location:</b></td>
 *    <td><b>Description:</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>SECURE_MODE</td>
 *    <td>BootloaderDFU.h</td>
 *    <td>If defined to true, the bootloader will not accept any memory commands other than a chip erase on start-up, until an
 *        erase has been performed. This can be used in conjunction with the AVR's lockbits to prevent the AVRs firmware from
 *        being dumped by unauthorized persons.</td>

 *  \section SSec_Description Project Description: 
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a CDC Class device (virtual serial port), allowing for AVR109
 *  protocol compatible programming software to load firmware onto the AVR.	
 *  
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the USB1287, and will fit into 4KB of bootloader space. If
 *  you wish to enlarge this space and/or change the AVR model, you will need to edit the BOOT_START and MCU
 *  values in the accompanying makefile.
 *  
 *  This bootloader is compatible with the open source application AVRDUDE, or Atmel's AVRPROG.
 *
 *  After running this bootloader for the first time on a new computer, you will need to supply the .INF
 *  file located in this bootloader project's directory as the device's driver when running under Windows.
 *  This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers, negating the need for custom drivers for the
 *  device. Other Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section SSec_Options Project Options

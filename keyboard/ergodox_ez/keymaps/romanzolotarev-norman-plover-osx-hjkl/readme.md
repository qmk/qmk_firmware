# Roman's Layout

There are four layers:

- **BASE** is [Norman layout](https://normanlayout.info/).
- **SYMB** for numbers and symbols.
- **PLVR** is optimized for [Plover](http://www.openstenoproject.org).
- **ARRW** for navigation (same fingers for arrows as HJKL on QWERTY).

Looking for IJKL arrows? [Here we

 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Generic HID device demonstration application. This gives a simple reference application
 *  for implementing a generic HID device, using the basic USB HID drivers in all modern
 *  OSes (i.e. no special drivers required). By default it accepts and sends up to 8 byte reports
 *  to and from a USB Host, and transmits the last sent report back to the host.
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function as a vendor HID device.
 *  When controlled by a custom HID class application, reports can be sent and received by
 *  both the standard data endpoint and control request methods defined in the HID specification.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
 *
 *  The following defines can be found in this demo, which can control the demo behaviour when defined, or changed in value.
 *
 *  <table>
 *   <tr>
 *    <th><b>Define Name:</b></th>
 *    <th><b>Location:</b></th>
 *    <th><b>Description:</b></th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *    <td>GENERIC_REPORT_SIZE</td>
 *    <td>AppConfig.h</td>
 *    <td>This token defines the size of the device reports, both sent and received (including report ID byte). The value
 *        must be an integer ranging from 1 to 255.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *  </table>

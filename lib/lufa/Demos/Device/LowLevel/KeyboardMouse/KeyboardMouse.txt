 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Keyboard/Mouse demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a composite device containing both USB Keyboard
 *  and USB Mouse functionality using the basic USB HID drivers in all modern OSes
 *  (i.e. no special drivers required). This example uses two separate HID
 *  interfaces for each function. It is boot protocol compatible, and thus works under
 *  compatible BIOS as if it was a native keyboard and mouse (e.g. PS/2).
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function
 *  as a keyboard when the USB connection to a host is present and the HWB is not
 *  pressed. When enabled, manipulate the joystick to send the letters
 *  a, b, c, d and e. See the USB HID documentation for more information
 *  on sending keyboard event and key presses.
 *
 *  When the HWB is pressed, the mouse mode is enabled. When enabled, move the
 *  joystick to move the pointer, and push the joystick inwards to simulate a
 *  left-button click.
 *

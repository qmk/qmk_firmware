 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Dual MIDI demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing the USB-MIDI class in USB devices.
 *  It is built upon the USB Audio class.
 *
 *  Joystick movements are translated into note on/off messages and
 *  are sent to the host PC as MIDI streams which can be read by any
 *  MIDI program supporting MIDI IN devices.
 *
 *  If the HWB is not pressed, the first virtual MIDI cable to the host is
 *  used. If the HWB is pressed, then the second virtual cable is selected.
 *
 *  This device implements MIDI-THRU mode, with the IN MIDI data being
 *  generated by the device itself. OUT MIDI data is discarded.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options

/* May be overridden with a custom value. Be aware that the effective
 * macro length is half of this value: each keypress is recorded twice
 * because of the down-event and up-event. This is not a bug, it's the
 * intended behavior.
 *
 * Usually it should be fine to set the macro size to at least 256 but
 * there have been reports of it being too much in some users' cases,
 * so 128 is considered a safe default.

/* For GPIOs on ARM-based MCUs, the input pins are sampled by the clock of the bus
 * to which the GPIO is connected.
 * The connected buses differ depending on the various series of MCUs.
 * And since the instruction execution clock of the CPU and the bus clock of GPIO are different,
 * there is a delay of several clocks to read the change of the input signal.
 *
 * Define this delay with the GPIO_INPUT_PIN_DELAY macro.
 * If the GPIO_INPUT_PIN_DELAY macro is not defined, the following default values will be used.
 * (A fairly large value of 0.25 microseconds is set.)

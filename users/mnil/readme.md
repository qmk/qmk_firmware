This keymap consist of four primary layers, `_COLEMAK`, `_SYMBOL`, `_NAVIGATION` and `_NUMPAD`.
Colemak layout for less finger travel distance and to reduce RSI.
The `_SYMBOL` layer is optimized for programming, specifically in `C++`.
Space and Enter do double duties as layer toggle on hold where the `_NUMPAD` is entered when both are held down.
`ALT+TAB` and `SHIFT+ALT+TAB` keys is implemented to register `ALT` and then `TAB` on each subsequent key press one leaves the `_NUMPAD`-layer.
The Swedish characters `åäöÅÄÖ` are added as a tap dances on top of the Colemak layer since they are rarely needed.

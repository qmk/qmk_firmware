# mattly's layouts

My layouts are based around:

* making the most from small layouts on keyboards like the iris or planck
* moving held-modifiers from pinkies to thumbs or home row, giving many keys dual purposes via mod/layer taps
* easy home-row navigation on a layer, using standard keys, available to all programs, not just a specially-configured editor
* easy access to punctuation symbols used in the programming languages I work in

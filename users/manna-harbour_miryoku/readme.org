[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/cover/miryoku-kle-cover-miryoku_qmk.png]]

[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/][Miryoku]] is an ergonomic, minimal, orthogonal, and universal keyboard layout.  [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku][Miryoku QMK]] is the Miryoku implementation for [[https://qmk.fm][QMK]].


** Branches


*** QMK master

QMK master is the current version of QMK, but usually does not contain the current version of Miryoku QMK.

QMK master is at https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master. The corresponding Miryoku QMK readme is at https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/manna-harbour_miryoku and describes the version of Miryoku QMK in QMK master.


*** Miryoku QMK development branch

The Miryoku QMK development branch is the current version of Miryoku QMK, but usually does not contain the current version of QMK.

The Miryoku QMK development branch is named ~miryoku~ and is at https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku. The corresponding Miryoku QMK readme is at https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku.

New commits can be seen at the top of the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/commits/miryoku][history]] with commit messages beginning ~[miryoku]~ or ~[miryoku-github]~

Periodically, the ~[miryoku]~ commits are squashed and merged upstream into QMK master by pull request, the ~miryoku~ branch is renamed, and a new ~miryoku~ branch is created from QMK master.


**** Merge

To use both the current versions of QMK and Miryoku QMK together, the QMK master and ~miryoku~ branches need to be merged.

The ~[miryoku-github]~ commits relate to GitHub specific functions of the Miryoku QMK repository and forks, such as workflows. Directly merging ~miryoku~ with a branch based on QMK master will lead to conflicts due to those commits. To avoid conflicts, first drop or revert all ~[miryoku-github]~ commits from ~miryoku~ before merging.

Merging branches can be performed automatically at build time for [[#workflow-builds][workflow builds]] using the ~merge~ option, which will automatically revert all ~[miryoku-github]~ commits before merging.  For local builds, see [[#checkout-update-and-merge][Checkout, Update, and Merge]] below.

Any local changes to existing workflow files should be made independently in commits with messages starting ~[miryoku-github]~ so that they can also be automatically excluded in workflow builds.


** Building


*** Local Builds

First [[https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started][set up the QMK build environment and build the default keymap for your keyboard]].

Next choose the [[#branches][branch]]. If using ~miryoku~, [[#checkout-update-and-merge][checkout, update, or merge]] as needed.

Build with ~manna-harbour_miryoku~ as the keymap name.  Personalised defaults for [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#alternative-layouts][alternative layout]] options can be set in [[#userspace][custom_rules.mk]].  Options can also be set or overridden at build time. Build with [[#qmk][qmk]] or [[#make][make]].


**** Checkout, Update, and Merge

All of the following examples operate in your existing QMK build environment.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
cd qmk_firmware
#+END_SRC

To checkout the ~miryoku~ branch from Miryoku QMK:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
git remote add miryoku_qmk git@github.com:manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk.git # if using SSH
git remote add miryoku_qmk https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk.git # if using HTTPS
git fetch miryoku_qmk
git checkout --track miryoku_qmk/miryoku
make git-submodule
#+END_SRC

To update the ~miryoku~ branch from Miryoku QMK:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
git checkout miryoku
git fetch miryoku_qmk
git merge miryoku_qmk/miryoku
#+END_SRC

If a new ~miryoku~ branch has been created in Miryoku QMK you will see ~(forced update)~ after the fetch. To rename the existing ~miryoku~ branch and create a new ~miryoku~ branch from Miryoku QMK:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
git checkout miryoku
git branch -m miryoku-`whoami`-`date --rfc-3339=date`
git fetch miryoku_qmk
git checkout --track miryoku_qmk/miryoku
make git-submodule
#+END_SRC

To [[#merge][merge]] the ~miryoku~ branch with QMK master:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
git checkout miryoku
git checkout -b miryoku-merge-master
git revert --no-edit `git log --grep='^\[miryoku-github\]' --pretty='format:%H' | tr '\n' ' '`
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
make git-submodule
#+END_SRC


**** qmk

Build with the ~qmk~ command.  E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
qmk compile -c -kb crkbd -km manna-harbour_miryoku # build for crkbd
qmk flash -c -kb crkbd -km manna-harbour_miryoku # build for crkbd and flash
qmk compile -c -kb crkbd -km manna-harbour_miryoku \
  -e MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY \
  -e MIRYOKU_EXTRA=COLEMAKDH \
  -e MIRYOKU_TAP=QWERTY \
  -e MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT \
  -e MIRYOKU_CLIPBOARD=WIN \
  -e MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP # build for crkbd with alternative layouts
#+END_SRC


**** make

First ~cd~ to the repository root.  Then build with ~make~. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make clean crkbd:manna-harbour_miryoku # build for crkbd
make clean crkbd:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash # build for crkbd and flash
make clean crkbd:manna-harbour_miryoku \
  MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY \
  MIRYOKU_EXTRA=COLEMAKDH \
  MIRYOKU_TAP=QWERTY \
  MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT \
  MIRYOKU_CLIPBOARD=WIN \
  MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP # build for crkbd with alternative layouts
#+END_SRC


*** Workflow Builds

Firmware can be built via GitHub Actions workflows without use of a local build environment.  Local tools are still required for [[https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_flashing][flashing]].

First [[#fork-or-sync][fork the Miryoku QMK repository or sync the ~miryoku~ branch]]. Then use the [[#build-examples][Build Examples]] or [[#build-inputs][Build Inputs]] workflows.

To access a workflow, visit the Actions tab and select the workflow.  To download the firmware from a workflow run, select the workflow, select the workflow run, select the desired Artifacts, and unzip the downloaded zip file.

Workflow files are in [[../../.github/workflows]].


**** Fork or Sync

If you don't have a fork, first [[https://github.com/signup][create a GitHub account]], [[https://github.com/login][login to GitHub]], [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository][fork]] https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk, and visit the Actions tab and enable workflows.

If you already have a fork, [[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-web-ui][sync]] the ~miryoku~ branch.

If a new ~miryoku~ branch has been created in Miryoku QMK, there will be a warning about conflicts when trying to sync.  If you have local changes, first create a copy of the branch by [[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch][creating a new branch]] and specifying the ~miryoku~ branch in your fork as the source, then sync the ~miryoku~ branch again.  Accept the prompt to discard commits.


**** Build Examples

Copy one of the included Build Example workflow files, edit the ~name~ value, and edit and add options and values as desired.  Select Run workflow, select the Branch if desired, and activate Run workflow.

Options are specified in the ~with~ section and are of the following form.
: option: '["value"]'

For multiple values per option use the following form, and a matrix build will be performed for each combination of values across all options.
: option: '["value1","value2"]'

The ~keyboard~ option specifies the keyboard and is required.  All other options are optional.

The ~alphas~, ~nav~, ~clipboard~, and ~layers~ options correspond to the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#alternative-layouts][alternative layout]] options.  The ~mapping~ option corresponds to the alternative [[#subset-mapping][mapping]] options.  Alternative layout and mapping options are given in the documentation in the form ~MIRYOKU_OPTION=VALUE~.  To use here, convert to the form specified above.  Use ~default~ to represent the default value.  Values for these five options are case-insensitive.  See the [[../../.github/workflows/test-all-configs.yml][Test All Configs workflow file]] for all supported values.

The ~rules~ and ~custom_config~ options can be used to specify values to be appended to ~custom_rules.mk~ and ~custom_config.h~, respectively.  Separate multiple lines with ~\n~.

The ~merge~ option can be used to merge branches at build time. Branches are specified in the form ~<user>/<repo>/<branch>~. E.g. QMK ~master~ and ~develop~ would be specified as ~qmk/qmk_firmware/master~ and ~qmk/qmk_firmware/develop~ respectively. Multiple space separated branches can be specified. For no merges, leave as ~default~.


**** Build Inputs

The Build Inputs workflow can be used without editing workflow files.  Select Run workflow, select the Branch and fill out the form as desired, and activate Run workflow.

Most options are specified by entering values directly in the corresponding field.  Multiple comma separated values can be entered per option and a matrix build will be performed for each combination of values across all options.

Values for Miryoku alternative layout options are selected from a list.  As multiple selection is not supported, matrix builds across multiple values are not possible for these options, and the Test Inputs or [[#build-examples][Build Example]] workflows should be used instead.

The ~Keyboard~ option specifies the keyboard and is required.  All other options are optional.

The ~Miryoku Alphas~, ~Miryoku Nav~, ~Miryoku Clipboard~, and ~Miryoku Layers~ options correspond to the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#alternative-layouts][alternative layout]] options.  The ~Miryoku Mapping~ option corresponds to the alternative [[#subset-mapping][mapping]] options.  Alternative layout and mapping options are given in the documentation in the form ~MIRYOKU_OPTION=VALUE~.  To use here, enter the ~value~ in the corresponding ~Miryoku Option~ field.  Use ~default~ to represent the default value.  Values for these five options are case-insensitive.

The ~custom_rules.mk~ and ~custom_config.h~ options can be used to specify values to be appended to the corresponding files.  Join multiple lines with ~\n~.

The ~Merge QMK Branches~ option can be used to merge branches at build time. Branches are specified in the form ~<user>/<repo>/<branch>~. E.g. QMK ~master~ and ~develop~ would be specified as ~qmk/qmk_firmware/master~ and ~qmk/qmk_firmware/develop~ respectively. Multiple space separated branches can be specified. For no merges, leave as ~default~.


** Subset Mapping

The keymap, build options, and configuration are shared between keyboards.  The
layout is mapped onto keyboards with different physical layouts as a subset
without code duplication using the QMK userspace feature and C macros.


*** Userspace

The keymap is defined for ~LAYOUT_miryoku~ which is 10x4, with the outer 2
positions on the bottom row unused and the rest of the bottom row being the
thumb keys.

- [[./rules.mk]] :: Build options.  Automatically included.

- [[./custom_rules.mk]] :: Custom ~make~ options including customised defaults for alternative layout and mapping options.  Included from ~rules.mk~.

- [[./post_rules.mk]] :: Handles Miryoku ~make~ options.  Included from ~rules.mk~.

- [[./config.h]] :: Config options.  Automatically included.

- [[./custom_config.h]] :: Custom config options.  Included from ~config.h~.

- [[./manna-harbour_miryoku.h]] :: Keymap-related definitions.  Included from ~manna-harbour_miryoku.c~.  Layer data is generated by [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_babel][Miryoku Babel]] and is included from files in the [[miryoku_babel]] directory.

- [[./manna-harbour_miryoku.c]] :: Contains the keymap.  Added from ~rules.mk~.


*** Community Layouts

To use the keymap on a keyboard supporting the community layouts feature,
~LAYOUT_miryoku~ is defined as a macro mapping onto the layout's own ~LAYOUT~
macro, leaving the unused keys as ~KC_NO~.

For keyboards supporting multiple layouts for which subset mappings are
available, select the layout with ~FORCE_LAYOUT~ in the ~make~ command line when
building.  E.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make planck/rev6:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash FORCE_LAYOUT=planck_mit # planck_mit
make planck/rev6:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash FORCE_LAYOUT=ortho_4x12 # ortho_4x12
#+END_SRC


**** 60_ansi

An angled ortho split layout is mapped onto the row-staggered keyboard.  The
rows are moved up to better position the thumb keys, the hands are separated as
much as possible, and the left hand column angle is reversed to reduce ulnar
deviation of the wrists.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-60_ansi.png]]

An alternative subset mapping is also provided without reverse column angle.  To
select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=NOREVERSEANGLE~ to the ~make~
command line when building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-60_ansi-noreverseangle.png]]

Another alternative subset mapping is provided mapping only the 3x10 alphas,
plus spacebar for space / Nav, with the remainder being the default 60_ansi
keymap with semicolon in place of quote. To select this mapping, append
~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=LITE~ to the ~make~ command line when building.

#+END_SRC


**** alice

This is a hybrid mapping.  Only the 3x10 alphas plus spacebars as primary thumb keys are mapped.  The remaining keys are the same as the default keymap but with semicolon in place of quote.  The keys adjacent to the spacebars are also mapped as corresponding thumb keys but may not be usable as such.

Keyboards supporting this layout: cheshire/curiosity, handwired/owlet60, mechlovin/adelais, projectkb/alice, sck/osa, axolstudio/yeti, coarse/cordillera, edda, evyd13/wonderland, fallacy, kb_elmo/sesame, keebsforall/coarse60, ramonimbao/aelith, sneakbox/aliceclone, tkc/osav2, zoo/wampus.


**** alice_split_bs

This is a hybrid mapping.  Only the 3x10 alphas plus spacebars as primary thumb keys are mapped.  The remaining keys are the same as the default keymap but with semicolon in place of quote.  The keys adjacent to the spacebars are also mapped as corresponding thumb keys but may not be usable as such.

**** ergodox

For the ergodox layout, the main 5x3 alphas are used as usual. The primary and
secondary thumb keys are the inner and outer 2u thumb keys and the tertiary
thumb key is the innermost key of the partial bottom row.  The remaining keys
are unused.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ergodox.png]]

An alternative subset mapping is provided with all keys shifted up one row creating thumb keys in the original alpha area.  To select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SHIFTED_ROWS~ to the ~make~ command line when building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ergodox-shifted_rows.png]]

Another alternative subset mapping is provided as for ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SHIFTED_ROWS~ but with the thumb keys shifted one position in the direction of thumb extension.  To select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SHIFTED_ROWS_EXTENDED_THUMBS~ to the ~make~ command line when building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ergodox-shifted_rows-extended_thumbs.png]]

Another alternative subset mapping is provided as for ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SHIFTED_ROWS_EXTENDED_THUMBS~ but with the pinkie column moved down one row.  To select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SHIFTED_ROWS_EXTENDED_THUMBS_PINKIE_STAGGER~ to the ~make~ command line when building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ergodox-shifted_rows-extended_thumbs-pinkie_stagger.png]]

Keyboards supporting this layout: ergodone, ergodox_ez, ergodox_infinity, hotdox.

#+END_SRC


**** ortho_4x12

For the ortho_4x12 layout, the middle two columns, and the 2 keys on each end of
the bottom row are unused.  This allows the hands to be positioned without ulnar
deviation of the wrists.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ortho_4x12.png]]

For split keyboards using this layout the halves can be positioned and rotated
for each hand and so an alternative mapping is provided.  The right half is as
follows: The rightmost column bottom 3 keys is the pinkie column.  The middle 4
columns top 3 rows are for the remaining fingers.  The pinkie column is one row
lower than the other columns to provide some column stagger.  The bottom row
left 3 keys are the thumb keys.  The remaining keys are unused.  To select this
mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SPLIT~ to the ~make~ command line when
building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ortho_4x12-split.png]]

An alternative with extended thumb position but without pinkie column stagger is

# Overview

This is my personal userspace file.  Most of my code exists here, as it's heavily shared.

## Custom Keycodes
See the babblepaste.md readme 

## Layer Indication

This uses the `layer_state_set_*` command to change the layer color, to indicate which layer it is on.  This includes the default keymap, as well.

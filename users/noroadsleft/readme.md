# @noroadsleft's Userspace

This directory holds the code that's the same for every keyboard I use in QMK, which is currently:

| Status             | Keyboard |
| :----------------- | :------- |
| :heavy_check_mark: | `kc60`
| :heavy_check_mark: | `kbdfans/kbd75/rev1`

## Features

### Emulated Non-US Backslash

Sends `KC_NUBS` when the Z key is tapped while the Right Alt key is being held.

### Emulated Numeric Keypad

Turns number row keycodes into their numeric keypad equivalents while the Right Alt key is being held.

### Emulated F13-F24

Turns F1-F12 into F13-F24 while the Right Alt key is being held.

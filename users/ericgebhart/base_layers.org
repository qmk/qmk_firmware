* Base Keymap Layers

These are all of the base layer definitions in this configuration.
There are over 50. I have grouped them as best I can into
files of related keymaps.  Keymap families of a sort.

I abandoned qwerty for dvorak more than  25 years ago
and that certainly saved me from my carpal tunnel symptoms.
I find keyboard layouts very interesting.
I like to learn and explore new layouts. So that is easy to do here.

** A Base Layer Template

*** Some Parts
We need all the parts to build our maps. Any keycodes we have, the language
key code fixer and the way to let the Oled know what our keymap looks like.
These are included here so no one else needs to.

#+begin_src C :tangle base_layers/base_layers.h
#include "custom_keycodes.h"
#include "lang_map.h"
#include "oled_stuff.h"
#+end_src

*** The Template

There are two parts here, the map of the keymap for the oled and the map
of the keymap for the keymap. Both are easy.

If the keymap you want to create has a family it belongs to and that family has a file/section,
then put it there. If not, create a new file, put your map in it and add it to the list.

In the template the names should match. Just replace 'EMPTY' in the template below with your
keymap name.

Names and layout part names all have *___triple-understores___*
at each end so they are easily identifiable as larger, or complete layer chunks.
This naming is also a remnant of the original wrapper code we used. I got tired of
all the underscores and shortened them right away.  I do like it this way as they
are easily seen and identified if named well.

**** Le carte de map
First is the Carte de map, The map of the keymap that we give to the Oled.
It takes 3 strings and you can put whatever you want in there. It may or may not
display properly as is the case with accent letters.   And dont let it get too long and
not fit. That doesn't work very well.

#+begin_src C :tangle base_layers/base_layers.h
// an empty template.

/* #define CARTE_EMPTY                \ */
/*   carte_de_map("  ",               \ */
/*                "  ",               \ */
/*                "  ") */
#+end_src

**** Key Map
This is the actual keymap. With the exception of the TL_ keycodes everything here is
indicated by an underscore and its letter. _A will indicate *KC__A* for en and *BP_A* for
Bépo.

This is the 5 column, 3x5 x 2 or 3x10, however you want to think of it, keymap.

#+begin_src C :tangle base_layers/base_layers.h
/*                      */
/* #define ___EMPTY___                             \ */
/*   LANG_MAP(_, _, _, _, _,   _, _, _, _, _,      \ */
/*            _, _, _, _, _,   _, _, _, _, _,      \ */

*** Beakl
**** Introduction
 beakl, balanced effort key layout.
 Beakl 15 and 19 are somewhat more related.
 Beakl-27 is the latest from 2020, The website for Beakl is now gone.
 Beakl-wi is a Beakl derivative from the darndest thing.


 Remember the - and ; outside pinky keys.
 Or use the 6 size.
 Both are on the symbol layer too. So you
 wont lose them at least. These are the TL keycodes. a more integrated
 solution awaits.

**** 19bis - French

I found this modified Beakl 19 in KLA data, it was a quick modification that added,
as easily as possible, the most common french accent letters to
the existing Beakl 19 keymap. Its scores were surprisingly good,
so I worked on it a little and came up with this one which is even better.

It scores better than Bépo and Dvorak, and Colemak in both English and french.
*YMMV!!*

These are  full 3x12 matrix layouts.

***** Least common french and english letters. *BEAKL 19bis* - Beakl/Bépo hybrid. English with French optimisations.

 Least used letters in french xzykw QJÀ are fairly high in use.

 XZ are good choices for pushing out, from english and french,
 or using chords in both languages. Bad choices for Vi.

 Note: The percentages came from different sources so do not
 match between languages.

Least used letters in French

 |---+--------|
 | Q | 0.89 % |
 | J | 0.71 % |
 | À | 0.54 % |

***** BEAKL 19bis - original.

The é and è were simply added for analysis by the KLA, not real use.
 even so, this layout scores well for french, better than bepo and mtgap.

  =qyouz  wdnck=
 =-hiea,  gtrsp;=
 =èj'é.x  vmlfb=

***** BEAKL 19bis mod z.
 French optimised with some english.
 This version rearranges things a little based on fequency.
 Dead keys and the most common accent keys are available.

 Since it needs 3x12, I filled in the corners and removed ;.
 Leaving y where it is. the o and the e might cause sfbs.
 Put é on a different finger from e.
 Swap z, e's, add à, ^, and ê, swap ; for -.
 It might be beneficial to swap w and à, as à is much more frequent than w

*** Bépo

 them into a 3x10 can be a challenge. The compact versions attempt
 that with some success.

 There are many variations.  Béop, Béopy, Godox-fr, etc. They are most
 easily found on the [[https:/bepo.fr][Bepo website]].

**** Vibranium

I've named these as they appeared in the discord channel for Vibranium.
*At the moment they use the same top puncuation line as the other HD layouts.  - fix this.*
There needs to be a =TL_HASH=. and a =*, but these are very personal things.


According to Alan's thoughts:
_Also, I think it would be more informative to refer to the Vibranium variations by the letter in the lower left. This would be 'vb'. The original would be 'vp' and the other would be 'vf'.
they're are super close._

**** Vibranium No alpha on thumb.

Alan created one like this.
I've added the less modified one that keeps punctuation.
One needs z on a combo and loses slash and quote.
The other needs zq and x on combos but keeps slash and quote.

**** Vibranium Alternate VF and VP

Alan: The W on pinky is a concern...this is a reasonable alternative.
A bit higher center column, of course, and fractionally higher SFBs, but the SC rolls are better, and the pinky is spared both F&W. redirects are still great.
Depends on where you might like your w.

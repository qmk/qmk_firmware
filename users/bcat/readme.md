# bcat's userspace

This is some code and config shared by all of [my](https://github.com/bcat)
keyboards. I use community layouts wherever possible, only writing
keyboard-specific keymaps for boards without standard layout support. I derive
my keymaps from two canonical ones (preferred for typing and gaming,
respectively).

You can build all keymaps I maintain at once using `./users/bcat/compile.sh`.

## Canonical keymaps

* [Split 3x6 + 3 thumb
keys](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/layouts/community/split_3x6_3/bcat):
Columnar-staggered split ergo layout, preferred for typing. Used on Crkbd.

* [60% Tsangan
HHKB](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/layouts/community/60_tsangan_hhkb/bcat):
Row-staggered layout, preferred for gaming. Used on ai03 Polaris, CannonKeys
AN-C, CannonKeys Instant60, DZ60.

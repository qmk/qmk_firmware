t.m.k. Keyboard Firmware
========================
This is keyboard firmware for PFU HHKB style keyboard and teensy 2.0.
OS see this as composite device which has keyboard and mouse.

The project is heavily based on PJRC USB Keyboard/Mouse Example and
owes a debt to preceding keyboard firmware projects.

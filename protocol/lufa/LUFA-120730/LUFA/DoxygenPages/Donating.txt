 *
 *  I am a 23 year old Atmel Applications Engineer, living in Trondheim, Norway and working on LUFA in my spare time.
 *  The development and support of this library requires much effort from myself, as I am the sole developer, maintainer
 *  and supporter. Please consider donating a small amount to support this and my future Open Source projects - All
 *  donations are <i>greatly</i> appreciated.
 *
 *  Note that commercial entities can remove the attribution portion of the LUFA license by a one-time fee - see
 *  \ref Page_LicenseInfo for more details (<b>Note: Please do NOT pay this in advance through the donation link below -
 *  contact author for payment details.</b>).

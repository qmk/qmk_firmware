/** \page Page_SchedulerOverview LUFA Scheduler Overview
 *
 *  The LUFA library comes with a small, basic round-robbin scheduler which allows for small "tasks" to be executed
 *  continuously in sequence, and enabled/disabled at runtime. Unlike a conventional, complex RTOS scheduler, the
 *  LUFA scheduler is very simple in design and operation and is essentially a loop conditionally executing a series
 *  of functions.
 *
 *  Each LUFA scheduler task should be written similar to an ISR; it should execute quickly (so that no one task
 *  hogs the processor, preventing another from running before some sort of timeout is exceeded). Unlike normal RTOS
 *  tasks, each LUFA scheduler task is a regular function, and thus must be designed to be called, and designed to
 *  return to the calling scheduler function repeatedly. Data which must be preserved between task calls should be
 *  declared as global or (prefferably) as a static local variable inside the task.
 *
 *  The scheduler consists of a task list, listing all the tasks which can be executed by the scheduler. Once started,
 *  each task is then called one after another, unless the task is stopped by another running task or interrupt.
 *
 *
 *  If desired, the LUFA scheduler <b>does not need to be used</b> in a LUFA powered application. A more conventional
 *  approach to application design can be used, or a proper scheduling RTOS inserted in the place of the LUFA scheduler.
 *  In the case of the former the USB task must be run manually repeatedly to maintain USB communications, and in the
 *  case of the latter a proper RTOS task must be set up to do the same.
 *
 *
 *  For more information on the LUFA scheduler, see the Scheduler.h file documentation.

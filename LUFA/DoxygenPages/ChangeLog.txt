  *      does not exist on these chips (thanks to Marco)
  *    - Changed all Device mode LowLevel demos and Device Class drivers so that the control request is acknowledged and any data
  *      transferred as quickly as possible without any processing in between sections, so that long callbacks or event handlers will
  *      not break communications with the host by exceeding the maximum control request stage timeout period

  *    - Changed LowLevel MIDI demos to only clear the incoming event bank once it has become empty to support packed event packets
  *

  *    - Fixed MIDI class driver send routines silently discarding packets if the endpoint or pipe is busy (thanks to Robin Green)
  *  - Library Applications:
  *    - Fixed MassStorage based demos and projects resetting the SCSI sense values before the command is executed, leading to
  *      missed SCSI sense values when the host retrieves the sense key (thanks to Martin Degelsegger)
  *    - Fixed USBtoSerial and Benito project SetLineEncoding calls failing if the USART is busy, due to the RX ISR delaying the control
  *      request handler
  *    - Fixed LowLevel PrinterHost demo not sending control requests to the attached printer with the correct printer interface wIndex value

  *
  *  <b>Changed:</b>
  *  - Deprecated pseudo-scheduler and removed dynamic memory allocator from the library (first no longer needed and second unused)
  *  - The device-mode CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor() function now has an extra parameter so that the memory space in which the requested
  *    descriptor is located can be specified. This means that descriptors can now be located in multiple memory spaces within a device.
  *  - Removed vague USB_IsConnected global - test USB_DeviceState or USB_HostState explicitly to gain previous functionality
  *  - Removed USB_IsSuspended global - test USB_DeviceState against DEVICE_STATE_Suspended instead
  *  - Extended USB_GetDeviceConfigDescriptor() routine to require the configuration number within the device to fetch
  *  - Dataflash_WaitWhileBusy() now always ensures that the dataflash is ready for the next command immediately after returning,
  *    no need to call Dataflash_ToggleSelectedChipCS() afterwards
  *  - Low level API MIDI device demo no longer blocks if a note change event is sent while the endpoint is not ready
  *  - Pipe_GetErrorFlags() now returns additional error flags for overflow and underflow errors

  *    the existing Pipe_SetFiniteINRequests() function
  *  - Changed F_USB entries in project makefiles to alias to F_CPU by default, as this is the most common case
  *  - Host mode demos now use sane terminal escape codes, so that text is always readable and events/program output is visually distinguished
  *    from one another using foreground colours
  *  - Internal per-device preprocessing conditions changed to per-device series rather than per-controller group for finer-grain
  *    internal control
  *  - Interrupts are no longer disabled during the processing of Control Requests on the default endpoint while in device mode
  *  - AudioOutput demos now always output to board LEDs, regardless of output mode (removed AUDIO_OUT_LEDS project option)
  *  - Removed SINGLE_DEVICE_CONFIGURATION compile time option in favor of the new FIXED_NUM_CONFIGURATIONS option so that the exact number
  *    of device configurations can be defined statically

  *  - Renamed and altered existing events to properly separate out Host and Device mode events
  *  - All demos switched over from GNU99 standards mode to C99 standards mode, to reduce the dependencies on GCC-only language extensions
  *
  *  <b>Fixed:</b>

  *    bootloaders on some of the USB AVR devices where avr-libc erroneously defines RAMPZ
  *  - Fixes to MassStorageHost for better device compatibility (increase command timeout, change MassStore_WaitForDataReceived()
  *    to only unfreeze and check one data pipe at a time) to prevent incorrect device enumerations and freezes while transferring data
  *  - Make Pipe_ConfigurePipe() mask the given endpoint number against PIPE_EPNUM_MASK to ensure the endpoint IN direction bit is
  *    cleared to prevent endpoint type corruption

  *  - Fixed MIDI demo, corrected Audio Streaming descriptor to follow the MIDI-specific AS structure
  *  - Fixed HID class demo descriptors so that the HID interface's protocol is 0x00 (required for non-boot protocol HID

  *    Pipe_SetInterruptPeriod() to use the correct terminology
  *  - UnicodeString member of USB_Descriptor_String_t struct changed to an ordinary int array type, so that the GCC
  *    Unicode strings (prefixed with an L before the opening quotation mark) can be used instead of explicit arrays
  *    of ASCII characters
  *  - Fixed Endpoint/Pipes being configured incorrectly if the maximum endpoint/pipe size for the selected USB AVR

  *    on USB AVRs with limited USB FIFO RAM

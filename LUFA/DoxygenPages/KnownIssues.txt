 /** \page Page_KnownIssues Known Issues
  *  The following are known issues present in each official LUFA release. This list should contain all known
  *  issues in the library. Most of these issues should be corrected in the future release - see
  *  \ref Page_FutureChanges for a list of planned changes in future releases.
  *
  *  \section Sec_KnownIssues120730 Version 120730
  *  - AVR8 Architecture
  *    - No known issues.
  *  - UC3 Architecture
  *    \warning The UC3 device support is currently <b>experimental</b> (incomplete and/or non-functional), and is included for preview purposes only. \n
  *
  *    - No demos, bootloaders or projects have been ported for the UC3 devices in the current release,
  *      although the architecture is supported in the LUFA core library.
  *    - DMA transfers to and from the USB controller are not yet implemented for this release.
  *    - The UC3C, UC3D and UC3L sub-families of UC3 are not currently supported by the library due to their
  *      altered USB controller design.
  *    - The various \c CreateStream() functions for creating standard \c <stdio.h> compatible virtual file
  *      streams are not available on the UC3 architecture, due to a lack of suitable library support.
  *  - XMEGA Architecture
  *    \warning The XMEGA device support is currently <b>experimental</b> (incomplete and/or non-functional), and is included for preview purposes only.
  *
  *    - No demos, bootloaders or projects have been ported for the XMEGA devices in the current release,
  *      although the architecture is supported in the LUFA core library.
  *    - Endpoints of more than 64 bytes are not currently supported in this release.
  *    - Isochronous endpoints are not currently supported in this release. As a result, the audio class
  *      cannot be used on XMEGA devices.
  *    - Multiple-bank endpoints are not currently supported in this release.
  *    - Early revisions of the ATXMEGA128A1U are incompatible with LUFA, due to their various errata
  *      relating to the USB controller.
  *  - Architecture Independent
  *    - The HID parser fails for array type elements that have a MIN and MAX usage applied; each element
  *      in the array will receive a unique incrementing usage from the MIN value, up to MAX.
  *    - The LUFA library is not watchdog aware, and thus timeouts are possible if short periods are used
  *      and a lengthy USB operation is initiated.
  *  - Build System
  *    - No known issues.

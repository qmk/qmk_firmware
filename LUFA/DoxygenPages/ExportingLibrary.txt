/** \page Page_ExportingLibrary Exporting the Library for IDE Use
 *
 *  While LUFA was designed to allow for easy compilation in a makefile driven environment,
 *  it is possible to export the library into a form suitable for drop-in use inside of an
 *  IDE.
 *
 *  \section Sec_LibraryExport Exporting the Library
 *  An export of the library is at its most basic, a direct copy of the main "LUFA" source folder from the
 *  root download folder; this contains the library core which can be re-used within external projects.
 *  However, as many IDEs attempt to automatically compile all included source files, it is neccesary to
 *  exclude some directories and files from the library core export to allow for easier integration into
 *  an IDE project.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_ManualExport Manual Export
 *  To manually export the library core, copy over the main LUFA library folder from the LUFA root directory,
 *  renaming as desired. Within the library core folder, the following directories should be removed or
 *  excluded from your IDE import:
 *   - Documentation/
 *   - DoxygenPages/
 *   - CodeTemplates/
 *
 *  If required, files from the CodeTemplates/ subdirectory may be copied to your IDE project as needed.
 *
 *  The resulting copy of the library may then be imported into your chosen IDE according to the instructions
 *  shown in \ref Sec_LibraryImport.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_AutomaticExport Automatic Export
 *  If desired, the steps indicated in \ref SSec_ManualExport may be automatically performed, by running the
 *  command <b><code>make export_tar</code></b> from the command line. This will generate two .tar files in the
 *  current directory, named <code>LUFA_YYMMDD.tar</code> and <code>LUFA_YYMMDD_Code_Templates.tar</code> (where
 *  "YYMMDD" is the version of the library being exported). The first archive contains the exported LUFA core
 *  with the non-required files removed, while the second contains an archived copy of the code template files 
 *  for the current LUFA version.
 *
 *  The resulting archived copy of the library may then be extracted to your chosen IDE project source directory
 *  and imported according to the instructions shown in \ref Sec_LibraryImport.
 *
 *  \section Sec_LibraryImport Importing the Library
 *  An exported copy of the library may be imported wholesale into an IDE project, if the instructions detailed
 *  in \ref Sec_LibraryExport are followed.
 *
 *  Specific instructions for importing an exported version of LUFA into various IDEs are listed below.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_AS56_Import Importing into AVRStudio 5/Atmel Studio 6
 *  To import LUFA into a new or existing project, the following steps must be followed.
 *
 *  \subsubsection SSSec_AS56_Import_Step1 Copy over the exported library
 *  Copy over the exported library archive created via the steps listed in \ref Sec_LibraryExport to your AS5/AS6
 *  project directory.

 *
 *  \subsubsection SSSec_AS56_Import_Step2 Extract exported library
 *  Extract out the contents of the archive to a new folder. This may be any name you wish, however keep in mind
 *  that this name will need to be referenced within your user application under most circumstances. It is
 *  suggested that this folder be named "LUFA", or "LUFA" followed by the version string for easy reference.
 *
 *  \image html Images/AS5_AS6_Import/AS5_AS6_Import_Step2.png
 *
 *  \subsubsection SSSec_AS56_Import_Step3 Add the library files
 *  Open your AVRStudio 5/Atmel Studio 6 project. From the "Solution Explorer" pane, click the "Show All Files"
 *  button on the toolbar to display ghosted icons of files and folders located in the project source directory
 *  that are not currently added to the project.
 *
 *  \image html Images/AS5_AS6_Import/AS5_AS6_Import_Step3.png
 *
 *  Right-click the ghosted version of the extracted LUFA export folder in the Solution Explorer pane, and
 *  choose the "Add to Project" option from the context menu. This will add the entire LUFA source tree to the
 *  current project.
 *
 *  \subsubsection SSSec_AS56_Import_Step4 Open Project Toolchain Properties
 *  In the Solution Explorer pane, click the project node, and press the "Properties" button in the toolbar to
 *  open the Project Properties window. This window allows you to configure the various project global compiler,
 *  assembler and linker options.
 *
 *  \image html Images/AS5_AS6_Import/AS5_AS6_Import_Step4.png
 * 
 *  Click the "Toolchain" tab on the left side of the Project Properties window.
 *
 *  \subsubsection SSSec_AS56_Import_Step5 Configure Project Toolchain Properties
 *
 *  In the GNU C Compiler section, open the "Symbols" page. Click the "Add Item" button to the top-right of the
 *  "Defined Symbols" section to add new symbols.
 *
 *  At a minimum, you will need to define the following symbols (for more information on these symbols, see
 *  \ref Page_ConfiguringApps):
 *   - ARCH
 *   - F_CPU
 *   - F_USB
 *   - BOARD
 *  \image html Images/AS5_AS6_Import/AS5_AS6_Import_Step5_1.png
 *
 *  Next, open the GNU C Compiler section's "Optimization" page. Ensure that the option to prepare functions for
 *  garbage collection is enabled.
 *  \image html Images/AS5_AS6_Import/AS5_AS6_Import_Step5_2.png
 *
 *  Finally, in the GNU C Linker section, open the "Optimization" page. Ensure that the option to garbage collect
 *  unused sections is selected.

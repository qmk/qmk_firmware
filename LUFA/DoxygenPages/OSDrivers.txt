/** \page Page_OSDrivers Operating System Drivers
 *
 *  Most of the USB classes supported by LUFA are also supported natively in
 *  most operating systems, without extra drivers being required. However, in
 *  some cases, a driver file is required in order for the device to enumerate
 *  and function correctly.
 *
 *  \section Sec_OSClassSupport Operating System USB Class Support
 *  The table below lists the supported LUFA USB classes, and their associated
 *  <i>native</i> support on modern operating systems.

 *  \section Sec_WinINFTemplates Windows INF Drivers
 *  Windows uses INF driver files to associate a USB device of a specific class,
 *  VID/PID ID pair, Windows Compatibility ID or other characteristic to a kernel
 *  driver. In most cases these files are build into the operating system, and
 *  no special user action or driver files are required for a device using a
 *  standard USB class to enumerate. However, for some classes, a specific INF
 *  driver must be created and given to the operating system for the device to
 *  enumerate.
 *
 *  Those USB classes requiring a custom INF driver file in Windows are listed
 *  below, along with a basic INF template for each class.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_WinINF_CDC Windows CDC INF Template
 *  This template is required for all CDC-ACM devices on Windows XP or newer.
 *  \verbinclude WindowsINF/CDC-ACM.inf
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_WinINF_RNDIS Windows RNDIS INF Template
 *  This template is required for all RNDIS devices on Windows XP or newer.
 *  \verbinclude WindowsINF/RNDIS.inf

/** \page Page_GettingStarted Getting Started
 *
 *  Out of the box, LUFA contains a large number of pre-made class demos for you to test, experiment with and
 *  ultimately build upon for your own projects. All the demos come pre-configured to build and run correctly
 *  on the AT90USB1287 AVR microcontroller, mounted on the Atmel USBKEY board and running at an 8MHz master clock.
 *  This is due to two reasons; one, it is the hardware the author posesses, and two, it is the most popular Atmel
 *  USB demonstration board to date.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Prerequisites Prerequisites
 *  Before you can compile any of the LUFA library code or demos, you will need a recent distribution of avr-libc (1.6.2+)
 *  and the AVR-GCC (4.2+) compiler. For Windows users, the best way to obtain these is the WinAVR project
 *  (http://winavr.sourceforge.net) as this provides a single-file setup for everything required to compile your
 *  own AVR projects.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Configuring Configuring the Demos, Bootloaders and Projects
 *  If the target AVR model, clock speed, board or other settings are different to the current settings, they must be changed
 *  and the project recompiled from the source code before being programmed into the AVR microcontroller. Most project
 *  configuration options are located in the "makefile" build script inside each LUFA application's folder, however some
 *  demo or application-specific configuration settings (such as the output format in the AudioOut demo) are located in the
 *  main .c source file of the project.
 *
 *  Each project "makefile" contains all the script and configuration data required to compile each project. When opened with
 *  any regular basic text editor such as Notepad or Wordpad (ensure that the save format is a pure ASCII text format) the
 *  build configuration settings may be altered.
 *
 *  Inside each makefile, a number of configuration variables are located, with the format "<VARIABLE NAME> = <VALUE>". For
 *  each application, the important variables which should be altered are:
 *
 *    - <b>MCU</b>, the target AVR processor.
 *    - <b>BOARD</b>, the target board hardware
 *    - <b>F_CPU</b>, the target AVR master clock frequency
 *    - <b>CDEFS</b>, the C preprocessor defines which configure the source code
 *
 *  These values should be changed to reflect the build hardware.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_MCU The MCU Parameter
 *  This parameter indicates the target AVR model for the compiled application. This should be set to the model of the target AVR
 *  (such as the AT90USB1287, or the ATMEGA32U4), in all lower-case (e.g. "at90usb1287"). Note that not all demos support all the
 *  USB AVR models, as they may make use of peripherals or modes only present in some devices.
 *
 *  For supported library AVR models, see main documentation page.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_BOARD The BOARD Parameter
 *  This parameter indicates the target AVR board hardware for the compiled application. Some LUFA library drivers are board-specific,
 *  such as the LED driver, and the library needs to know the layout of the target board. If you are using one of the board models listed
 *  on the main library page, change this parameter to the board name in all UPPER-case.
 *
 *  If you are not using any board-specific drivers in the LUFA library, or you are using a custom board layout, change this to read
 *  "USER" (no quotes) instead of a standard board name. If the USER board type is selected and the application makes use of one or more
 *  board-specific hardware drivers inside the LUFA library, then the appropriate stub drives files should be copied from the /BoardStubs/
 *  directory into a /Board/ folder inside the application directory, and the stub driver completed with the appropriate code to drive the
 *  custom board's hardware.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_F_CPU The F_CPU Parameter
 *  This parameter indicates the target AVR's master clock frequency, in Hz. Consult your AVR model's datasheet for allowable clock frequencies
 *  if the USB interface is to be operational.
 *
 *  <b>Note that this value does not actually *alter* the AVR's clock frequency</b>, it is just a way to indicate to the library the clock frequency
 *  of the AVR as set by the AVR's fuses. If this value does not reflect the actual running frequency of the AVR, incorrect operation of one of more
 *  library components will ocurr.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_CDEFS The CDEFS Parameter
 *  Most applications will actually have multiple CDEF lines, which are concatenated together with the "+=" operator. This ensures that large
 *  numbers of configuration options remain readable by splitting up groups of options into seperate lines.
 *
 *  Normally, these options do not need to be altered to allow an application to compile and run correctly on a different board or AVR to the
 *  current configuration - if the options are incorrect, then the demo is most likely incompatible with the chosen USB AVR model and cannot be
 *  made to function through the altering of the makefile settings alone (or at all). Settings such as the USB mode (device, host or both), the USB
 *  interface speed (Low or Full speed) and other LUFA configuration options can be set here - refer to the library documentation for details on the
 *  configuration parameters.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Compiling Compiling a LUFA Application
 *  Compiling the LUFA demos, applications and/or bootloaders is very simple. LUFA comes with makefile scripts for
 *  each individual demo, bootloader and project folder, as well as scripts in the /Demos/, /Bootloaders/, /Projects/
 *  and the LUFA root directory. This means that compilation can be started from any of the above directories, with
 *  a build started from an upper directory in the directory structure executing build of all child directories under it.
 *  This means that while a build inside a particular demo directory will build only that particular demo, a build stated
 *  from the /Demos/ directory will build all LUFA demo projects sequentially.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_CommandLine Via the Command Line
 *  To build a project from the source via the command line, the command <b>"make all"</b> should be executed from the command line in the directory
 *  of interest. To remove compiled files (including the binary output, all intermediatary files and all diagnostic output
 *  files), execute <b>"make clean"</b>. Once a "make all" has been run and no errors were encountered, the resulting binary will
 *  be located in the generated ".HEX" file. If your project makes use of pre-initialized EEPROM variables, the generated ".EEP"
 *  file will contain the project's EEPROM data.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_AVRStudio Via AVRStudio
 *  Each demo, project and bootloader contains an AVRStudio project (.aps) which can be used to build each project. Once opened
 *  in AVRStudio, the project can be built and cleaned using the GUI buttons or menus. Note that the AVRStudio project files make
 *  use of the external project makefile, thus the procedure for configuring a demo remains the same regardless of the build environment.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Programming Programming a USB AVR
 *  Once you have built an application, you will need a way to program in the resulting ".HEX" file (and, if your
 *  application uses EEPROM variables with initial values, also a ".EEP" file) into your USB AVR. Normally, the
 *  reprogramming an AVR device must be performed using a special piece of programming hardware, through one of the
 *  supported AVR programming protocols - ISP, HVSP, HVPP, JTAG or dW. This can be done through a custom programmer,
 *  a third party programmer, or an official Atmel AVR tool - for more information, see the Atmel.com website.
 *
 *  Alternatively, you can use the bootloader. From the Atmel factory, each USB AVR comes preloaded with the Atmel
 *  DFU (Device Firmware Update) class bootloader, a small piece of AVR firmware which allows the remainder of the
 *  AVR to be programmed through a non-standard interface such as the serial USART port, SPI, or (in this case) USB.
 *  Bootloaders have the advantage of not requiring any special hardware for programming, and cannot usually be erased
 *  or broken without an external programming device. They have disadvantages however; they cannot change the fuses of
 *  the AVR (special configuration settings that control the operation of the chip itself) and a small portion of the
 *  AVR's FLASH program memory must be reserved to contain the bootloader firmware, and thus cannot be used by the
 *  loaded application. Atmel's DFU bootloader is either 4KB (for the smaller USB AVRs) or 8KB (for the larger USB AVRs).
 *
 *  If you wish to use the DFU bootloader to program in your application, refer to your DFU programmer's documentation.
 *  Atmel provides a free utility called FLIP which is USB AVR compatible, and an open source (Linux compatible)
 *  alternative exists called "dfu-programmer".

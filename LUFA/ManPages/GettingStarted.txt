 *
 *  Out of the box, LUFA contains a large number of pre-made class demos for you to test, experiment with and
 *  ultimately build upon for your own projects. All the demos come pre-configured to build and run correctly
 *  on the AT90USB1287 AVR microcontroller, mounted on the Atmel USBKEY board and running at an 8MHz master clock.
 *  This is due to two reasons; one, it is the hardware the author possesses, and two, it is the most popular Atmel
 *  USB demonstration board to date. To learn how to reconfigure, recompile and program the included LUFA applications
 *  using different settings, see the following subsections.

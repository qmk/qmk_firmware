/** \page Page_CompilingApps Compiling the Demos, Bootloaders and Projects
 *
 *  The following details how to compile the included LUFA demos, applications and bootloaders using AVR-GCC.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Prerequisites Prerequisites
 *  Before you can compile any of the LUFA library code or demos, you will need a recent distribution of avr-libc (1.6.2+)
 *  and the AVR-GCC (4.2+) compiler. For Windows users, the best way to obtain these is the WinAVR project
 *  (<a>http://winavr.sourceforge.net</a>) as this provides a single-file setup for everything required to compile your
 *  own AVR projects.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Compiling Compiling a LUFA Application
 *  Compiling the LUFA demos, applications and/or bootloaders is very simple. LUFA comes with makefile scripts for
 *  each individual demo, bootloader and project folder, as well as scripts in the /Demos/, /Bootloaders/, /Projects/
 *  and the LUFA root directory. This means that compilation can be started from any of the above directories, with
 *  a build started from an upper directory in the directory structure executing build of all child directories under it.
 *  This means that while a build inside a particular demo directory will build only that particular demo, a build stated
 *  from the /Demos/ directory will build all LUFA demo projects sequentially.
 *
 *  To build a project from the source via the command line, the command <b>"make all"</b> should be executed from the command line in the directory
 *  of interest. To remove compiled files (including the binary output, all intermediately files and all diagnostic output
 *  files), execute <b>"make clean"</b>. Once a "make all" has been run and no errors were encountered, the resulting binary will
 *  be located in the generated ".HEX" file. If your project makes use of pre-initialized EEPROM variables, the generated ".EEP"
 *  file will contain the project's EEPROM data.

  *    internal control
  *  - Interrupts are no longer disabled during the processing of Control Requests on the default endpoint while in device mode
  *  - AudioOutput demos now always output to board LEDs, regardless of output mode (removed AUDIO_OUT_LEDS project option)

  *  - Renamed and altered existing events to properly seperate out Host and Device mode events
  *
  *  <b>Fixed:</b>

  *  - Fixes to MassStorageHost for better device compatibility (increase command timeout, change MassStore_WaitForDataReceived()
  *    to only unfreeze and check one data pipe at a time) to prevent incorrect device enumerations and freezes while trasferring data

  *  - Rewritten event system to remove all macros, to make user code clearer

  *  - Removed Tx interrupt from the USBtoSerial demo; now sends characters via polling to ensure more time for the Rx interrupt
  *  - Fixed possible enumeration errors from spinloops which may fail to exit if the USB connection is severed before the exit condition
  *    becomes true
  *
  *

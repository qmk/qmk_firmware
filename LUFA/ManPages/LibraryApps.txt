 *
 *  The LUFA library ships with several different host and device demos, located in the /Demos/ subdirectory. Within this
 *  directory the demos are seperated by USB mode (Device, Host, OTG) and further seperated by the use or non-use of the
 *  library USB Class drivers (which abstract out the actual implementation of the USB classes to simplify development even
 *  further at the expense of a loss of flexibility).
 *
 *  With one or two exceptions (e.g. proprietary classes such as RNDIS) all the included demos will work across all OSes without
 *  the need for special drivers. On Windows, some demos require the supplied .INF file to be used as the device driver, which
 *  directs the OS to use its inbuilt class drivers for the device.
 *
 *  Also included with the library are three fully functional bootloaders, located in the /Bootloaders/ subdirectory.
 *  The DFU class bootloader is compatible with Atmel's FLIP software or the open source dfu-programmer project, the
 *  CDC class (AVR109 protocol) is compatible with such open source software as AVRDUDE and AVR-OSP, and the TeensyLoader
 *  HID class bootloader is compatible with the software from PJRC (<a>http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html</a>).
 *
 *  User-submitted projects are located in the /Projects/ subdirectory. If you wish to have your LUFA project included,
 *  please email it to the Library author.

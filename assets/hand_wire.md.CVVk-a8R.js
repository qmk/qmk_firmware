Further information can be found in the <a href="./features/split_keyboard">QMK split keyboard documentation.</a></p><h3 id="soldering" tabindex="-1">Soldering <a class="header-anchor" href="#soldering" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Soldering&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are a lot of soldering guides and tips available elsewhere but here are some of the most useful and relevant for hand wiring:</p><p>To ensure a strong solder joint you want a good amount of contact between the solder and the two pieces of metal you are connecting. A good way of doing this (though not required) is looping around pins or twisting wires together before applying solder.</p><img src="' + _imports_10 + '" alt="Looped around rod" width="400"><p>If your diodes are on a packaging strip and need a bend in them (either the start of a loop or for connecting to its neighbour) this can easily done by bending it over something straight like the edge of a box, table, or ruler. This also helps keep track of the direction of the diode as all the bends will be on the same side.</p><img src="' + _imports_11 + '" alt="Bent diode legs" width="400"><p>If your iron has temperature control, set it to 315ºC (600ºF).</p><p>Once heated, tin your soldering iron - this means melting a small amount of solder on the end of the iron and then quickly wiping it off on a wet sponge or wire cleaning pad, leaving a shiny silvery coating on the end which helps keep oxidisation at bay and helps solder to flow.</p><p>When you come to apply the solder, hold the soldering iron against the two surfaces for a second to heat it, then apply a small amount of solder to join the two pieces together. Heating the surfaces ensures that the solder adheres to it and that it does not cool too quickly.</p><p>Don&#39;t hold the iron on the solder/joint longer than necessary. Heat will be conducted through the surfaces and can damage components (melt switch housings etc.). Also, solder contains flux, which aids in <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&quot;wetting&quot;</a>. The longer heat is applied to the solder the more flux will evaporate meaning you may end up with a bad solder joint with peaks which, apart from looking bad, may also increase the risk of electrical shorts.</p><h4 id="soldering-the-diodes" tabindex="-1">Soldering the Diodes <a class="header-anchor" href="#soldering-the-diodes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Soldering the Diodes&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Starting at the top-left switch, place the diode (with tweezers if you have them) on the switch so that the diode itself is vertically aligned, and the black line is facing toward you. Make sure the diodes are soldered in parallel (diode outputs shouldn&#39;t connect to diode inputs). The input lead of the diode should be touching the left contact on the switch, and the bent, output end should be facing to the right and resting on the switch there, like this:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noroadsleft/qmk_images/master/docs/hand_wire/soldering-diodes-01.png" alt="soldering-diodes-01.png"></p><p>Letting the diode rest, grab your solder, and touch both it and the soldering iron to the left contact at the same time - the rosin in the solder should make it easy for the solder to flow over both the diode and the keyswitch contact. The diode may move a little, and if it does, carefully position it back it place by grabbing the bent end of the diode - the other end will become hot very quickly. If you find that it&#39;s moving too much, using needle-nose pliers of some sort may help to keep the diode still when soldering.</p><p>The smoke that the rosin releases is harmful, so be careful not to breath it or get it in your eyes/face.</p><p>After soldering things in place, it may be helpful to blow on the joint to push the smoke away from your face, and cool the solder quicker. You should see the solder develop a matte (not shiny) surface as it solidifies. Keep in mind that it will still be very hot afterwards, and will take a couple minutes to be cool to touch. Blowing on it will accelerate this process.</p><p>When the first diode is complete, the next one will need to be soldered to both the keyswitch, and the previous diode at the new elbow. That will look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noroadsleft/qmk_images/master/docs/hand_wire/soldering-diodes-02.png" alt="soldering-diodes-02.png"></p><p>After completing a row, use the wire cutters to trim the excess wire from the tops of the diodes, and from the right side on the final switch. This process will need to completed for each row you have.</p><p>When all of the diodes are completely soldered, it&#39;s a good idea to quickly inspect each one to ensure that your solder joints are solid and sturdy - repairing things after this is possible, but more difficult.</p><h4 id="soldering-the-columns" tabindex="-1">Soldering the Columns <a class="header-anchor" href="#soldering-the-columns" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Soldering the Columns&quot;">​</a></h4><p>You&#39;ll have some options in the next process - it&#39;s a good idea to insulate the column wires (since the diodes aren&#39;t), but if you&#39;re careful enough, you can use exposed wires for the columns - it&#39;s not recommended, though. If you&#39;re using single-cored wire, stripping the plastic off of the whole wire and feeding it back on is probably the best option, but can be difficult depending on the size and materials. You&#39;ll want to leave parts of the wire exposed where you&#39;re going to be solder it onto the keyswitch.</p><p>If you&#39;re using stranded wire, it&#39;s probably easiest to just use a lot of small wires to connect each keyswitch along the column. It&#39;s possible to use one and melt through the insulation, but this isn&#39;t recommended, will produce even more harmful fumes, and can ruin your soldering iron.</p><p>Before beginning to solder, it helps to have your wire pre-bent (if using single-cored), or at least have an idea of how you&#39;re going to route the column (especially if you&#39;re making a staggered board). Where you go in particular doesn&#39;t matter too much, as we&#39;ll be basing our keymap definitions on how it was wired - just make sure every key in a particular row is in a unique column, and that they&#39;re in order from left to right.</p><p>If you&#39;re not using any insulation, you can try to keep the column wires elevated, and solder them near the tips of the keyswitch contacts - if the wires are sturdy enough, they won&#39;t short out to the row wiring an diodes.</p><h2 id="wiring-up-the-controller" tabindex="-1">Wiring up the controller <a class="header-anchor" href="#wiring-up-the-controller" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wiring up the controller&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Now that the matrix itself is complete, it&#39;s time to connect what you&#39;ve done to the microcontroller board.</p><p>Place the microcontroller where you want it to be located, give thought to mounting and case alignment. Bear in mind that the location of the USB socket can be different from the controller by using a short male to female cable if required,.</p><p>Find the pinout/documentation for your microcontroller board (<a href="#common-microcontroller-boards">links here</a>) and make a note of all the digital I/O pins on it (note that on some controllers, like the teensy, analogue I/O can double as digital) as these are the pins you want to connect your wires to.</p><hr><h3 id="specific-instructions-for-the-teensy-2-0" tabindex="-1">Specific instructions for the Teensy 2.0 <a class="header-anchor" href="#specific-instructions-for-the-teensy-2-0" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Specific instructions for the Teensy 2.0&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are some pins on the Teensy that are special, like D6 (the LED on the chip), or some of the UART, SPI, I2C, or PWM channels, but only avoid those if you&#39;re planning something in addition to a keyboard. If you&#39;re unsure about wanting to add something later, you should have enough pins in total to avoid a couple.</p><p>The pins you&#39;ll absolutely have to avoid, as with any controller, are: GND, VCC, AREF, and RST - all the others are usable and accessible in the firmware.</p><hr><p>Cut wires to the length of the distance from the a point on each column/row to the controller. You can solder anywhere along the row, as long as it&#39;s after the diode - soldering before the diode (on the keyswitch side) will cause that row not to work.</p><p>Ribbon cable can be used to keep this extra tidy. You may also want to consider routing the wires beneath the existing columns/rows.</p><img src="' + _imports_12 + '" alt="Ribbon Cable" width="600"><p>As you solder the wires to the controller make a note of which row/column is going to which pin on the controller as we&#39;ll use this data to setup the matrix when we create the firmware.</p><p>As you move along, be sure that the controller is staying in place - recutting and soldering the wires is a pain!</p><h2 id="getting-some-basic-firmware-set-up" tabindex="-1">Getting Some Basic Firmware Set Up <a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-some-basic-firmware-set-up" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Getting Some Basic Firmware Set Up&quot;">​</a></h2><p>From here, you should have a working keyboard once you program a firmware.</p><p>Simple firmware can be created easily using the <a href="https://kbfirmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Keyboard Firmware Builder</a> website.

If you touch it with a moderate amount of force and it comes apart, it&#39;s not strong enough.</li><li>Check the solder joints on the diode - if the diode is loose, part of your row may register, while the other may not.</li><li>Check the solder joints on the columns - if your column wiring is loose, part or all of the column may not work.</li><li>Check the solder joints on both sides of the wires going to/from the Teensy - the wires need to be fully soldered and connect to both sides.</li><li>Check the <code>&lt;project_name&gt;.h</code> file for errors and incorrectly placed <code>KC_NO</code>s - if you&#39;re unsure where they should be, instead duplicate a k<em>xy</em> variable.</li><li>Check to make sure you actually compiled the firmware and flashed the Teensy correctly.
